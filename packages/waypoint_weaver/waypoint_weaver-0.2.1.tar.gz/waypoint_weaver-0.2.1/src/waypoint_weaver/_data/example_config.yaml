# Coordinates of the waypoints
# Each coordinate consists of 3 parts:
# - name: A note to help the organizer identify the waypoint
# - coordinate: The latitude and longitude of the current waypoint
# - solution: The solution to the riddle at the current waypoint
#   Caution! The solution will point to the next waypoint in the list (not the current coordinate). This is a bit confusing.
# The order of the waypoints is assumed to be the order in which they will be visited. The last waypoint will wrap around to the first waypoint.
# You cannot have more teams than waypoints.
