# AI-Text-to-SQL: Transforming Text Queries into SQL Magic ✨

Have you ever wished you could simply speak or type your queries in plain English, and poof! They magically turn into perfectly formatted SQL queries? Well, say hello to AI-Text-to-SQL - the enchanting Python package that brings your dream to life!

## Unleashing the Magic 🌟

### With pip

Installing AI-Text-to-SQL is as easy as pip-pip-pip:

```
pip install ai_text_to_sql
```

## Casting the Spell: AI-Text-to-SQL in Action 🎩✨

To summon the power of AI-Text-to-SQL, follow these mystical steps and witness the enchantment unfold!

### Step 1: Prepare Your Spell Ingredients 🌟

Begin by importing the essential components for your SQL sorcery:

- **Import the Data Connector**: Choose the right data connector, like selecting the perfect wand for your SQL spellcasting.
- **Import the LLM Connector**: This vital ingredient enhances the mystical abilities of `ai_text_to_sql`, enabling it to comprehend your text queries like a seasoned SQL wizard.

Let's summon the SQLite and OpenAI connectors to embark on our magical SQL adventure:

```python
from ai_text_to_sql.data_connectors import SQLiteConnector
from ai_text_to_sql.llm_connectors import OpenAIConnector
```

Now, define the magical incantation you wish to transform into SQL:

```python
text_query = "Find all the tracks written by AC/DC, including the track name, album " \
             "title and the artist name. Sort the results alphabetically by track name."
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Path of Power 🌟

#### 🧙‍♂️ Conjuring the Core SQL Spell with `TextToSQL`

For those who seek to transform text into SQL queries with pure magic, invoke `TextToSQL`:

```python
from ai_text_to_sql import TextToSQL

sqlite_connector = SQLiteConnector(database='chinook.db')
openai_connector = OpenAIConnector(api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')

text_to_sql = TextToSQL(sqlite_connector, openai_connector)

# Witness the spell's transformation 🔮✨
sql_query = text_to_sql.convert_text_to_sql(text_query)

# Unleash the magic upon the database directly 💾✨
results = text_to_sql.query(text_query)

# Store the results in a DataFrame for further sorcery 📊✨
df = text_to_sql.query_df(text_query)
```

#### 🧙‍♀️ Summoning the Enchanted Conversationalist with `TextToSQLChat` (New!)

For those who desire the power of `TextToSQL` but with memory, `TextToSQLChat` allows ongoing dialogue with your SQL queries:

```python
from ai_text_to_sql import TextToSQLChat

text_to_sql = TextToSQLChat(sqlite_connector, openai_connector)

# Begin the conversation with the initial query 🗣️✨
results = text_to_sql.query(text_query)
# OR
df = text_to_sql.query_df(text_query)

# Continue the dialogue with a follow-up query 🗣️✨
follow_up_query = "OK, now let's do Queen"

follow_up_results = text_to_sql.query(follow_up_query)
# OR
follow_up_df = text_to_sql.query_df(follow_up_query)
```

#### 🌯 Unlocking Advanced Sorcery with `TextToSQLAgent` (New!)

For those who seek a fully autonomous SQL assistant, `TextToSQLAgent` orchestrates multi-step reasoning, follow-ups, and intelligent query crafting:

```python
from ai_text_to_sql import TextToSQLAgent

text_to_sql_agent = TextToSQLAgent(sqlite_connector, openai_connector)

# Engage the AI agent in a conversation 🤖✨
response = text_to_sql_agent.query(text_query)

# Continue the dialogue with a follow-up query 🤖✨
follow_up_query = "OK, now let's do Led Zeppelin"
follow_up_response = text_to_sql_agent.query(follow_up_query)
```

With these powerful artifacts at your disposal, you are now equipped to master the arcane arts of AI-driven SQL spellcasting! 🌟🎉
