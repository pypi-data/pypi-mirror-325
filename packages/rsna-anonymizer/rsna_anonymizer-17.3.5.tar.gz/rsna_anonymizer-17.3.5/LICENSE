RSNA-MIRC Public License

1. RSNA MIRC Public License Version 2.0
THIS LICENSE APPLIES TO ALL SOURCE CODE MODULES THAT CONTAIN THE NOTATION:
This source software is released under the terms of the RSNA Public License.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Source Code Module" means a computer program source code file.
"Original Module" means the original version of a Source Code Module as distributed
by the Radiological Society of North America, Inc. ("RSNA").
"Derivative Work" means any computer program, either in source or object form, which
incorporates Original Modules in whole or in part.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives Original Modules or Derivative Works under this
Agreement.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a. The RSNA hereby grants to each Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform,
and distribute Original Modules.
b. The RSNA hereby grants to each Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to prepare Derivative Works and to publicly display,
publicly perform, sell, distribute and sublicense such Derivative Works.
c. Recipient understands that the RSNA provides no assurances that the Original
Modules do not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
other entity. The RSNA disclaims any liability to Recipients for claims brought
by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any
other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Original
Modules or Derivative Works, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
license before distributing the Program.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Recipient may choose to distribute Original Modules or Derivative works in source
or object code form under its own license agreement, provided that it complies with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
When Derivative Works are made available in source code form, any unmodified Original
Modules that are included must retain the copyright notice and the notation
referencing this agreement. Any modified Original Modules must contain a notation
identifying the developer of the Derivative Work in a manner that reasonably allows
subsequent Recipients to identify the developer.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of Derivative Works may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended
to facilitate the commercial use of Original Modules in Derivative Works, a 
distributor who includes Original Modules in a commercial product offering must do so
in a manner that does not create potential liability for the RSNA. Therefore, if a
distributor ("Commercial Distributor") includes Original Modules in a commercial
product offering, such Commercial Distributor hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
the RSNA against any losses, damages and costs arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the RSNA to the extent caused by
or based upon the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with
its distribution of the Derivative Work in a commercial product offering.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE ORIGINAL MODULES ARE PROVIDED ON
AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Original Modules and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of programming
errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO RECIPIENT SHALL HAVE ANY
LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE ORIGINAL MODULES
OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of
this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois and the intellectual
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement may bring a
legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.
Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
