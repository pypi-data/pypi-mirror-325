Installation and getting started
===================================

Requirements
------------
The chap-core Python package requires Python 3.10 or higher, and is tested to work on Windows, Linux and MacOS. 
Most of the built-in forecasting models in CHAP require Docker to run, and we recommend also using Docker to setup 
chap-core for most use-cases (see below). The current builtin-models are not resource-intensive and one should be 
fine with 4 GB of RAM.

Installation of CHAP depends on how you want to use CHAP, so here we present several possible ways to install CHAP: 

- :ref:`Setting up CHAP Core CLI tool </chap-core-setup.rst>`_

- :ref:`Setting up CHAP REST-API locally with Docker </installation/docker-compose-doc.md>`_

- :ref:`Setting up CHAP REST-API on a server </installation/running-chap-on-server.md>`_

- :ref:`Setting up CHAP Prediction App in DHIS2 </installation/prediction-app-setup.md>`_
