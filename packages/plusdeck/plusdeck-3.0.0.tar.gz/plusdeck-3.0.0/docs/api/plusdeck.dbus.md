# plusdeck.dbus

The `plusdeck` library includes a DBus service and client. This service allows for multitenancy on Linux - the centralized service controls the serial bus, and clients - including `plusdeckctl` - can connect to the service.

For information on the service daemon and CLI client, visit [the main DBus documentation](../dbus.md).
