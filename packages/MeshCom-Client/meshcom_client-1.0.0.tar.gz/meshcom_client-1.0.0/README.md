## What is this about?
This is a MeshCom-Client, that is written in Python for simple usage on a compatible computer system. Initially it is with very basic functionality but I think it will grow up over the next weeks :-)

## How to start
* Install python3 and fullfill requirements by installing all missing libraries.
* Connect your MeshCom-Node to your serial terminal and issue the following commands, to start the node to transfer data via udp to your computer:
** --extudpip <ip of your computer>
** --extudp on
* Go to Settings and put in the new destination ip address = ip of your node.

Now it should be running!

## ToDos
