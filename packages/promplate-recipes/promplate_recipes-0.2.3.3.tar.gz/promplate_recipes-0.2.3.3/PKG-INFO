# Recipes

This repo is a collection of useful utilities I generally use in projects created with [`promplate`](https://promplate.dev).

Since they are somewhat opinionated, I chose not to include them in the [`core`](https://github.com/promplate/core) package.
However, I believe they follow best practices and can be quite useful.
