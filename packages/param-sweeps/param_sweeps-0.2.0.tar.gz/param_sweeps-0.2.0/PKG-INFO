Param-sweeps
============

A Parameter sweeper for applications driven by ui.json files

This package contains two main modules.  One is for generating sweep
files, and the other is to run a sweep over some number of parameters
in a driver application.


Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate a sweep file from a ui.json file for an existing
application, use the following command::

    $ python -m param_sweeps.generate some_file.ui.json

This will create a new ``some_file_sweep.ui.json`` file that may be run
with::

    $ python -m param_sweeps.driver some_file_sweep.ui.json

By default, this would execute a single run of the original parameters.
To design a sweep, simply drag the ``some_file_sweep.ui.json`` file into
`Geoscience ANALYST Pro <https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst-pro/>`_.
session that produced the original file and select start, end, and number
of samples values for parameters that you would like to sweep.


To organize the output, param-sweeps uses a ``UUID`` file naming scheme, with
a ``lookup.json`` file to map individual parameter sets back to their respective
files.
