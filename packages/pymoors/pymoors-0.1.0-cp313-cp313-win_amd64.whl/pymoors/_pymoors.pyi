class SimulatedBinaryCrossover(CrossoverOperator):
    """
    Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) operator for real-coded genetic algorithms.

    SBX is a widely used crossover mechanism for continuous variables, inspired
    by the behavior of single-point crossover in binary-coded GAs. Instead of
    slicing bit strings, SBX generates offspring by interpolating (and potentially
    extrapolating) between two parent solutions (p1 and p2).

    The key parameter `distribution_index` (often called "eta") controls how far
    the offspring can deviate from the parents. A higher distribution index results
    in offspring closer to the parents (exploitation), whereas a lower value
    produces offspring that can be further away (exploration).

    In each crossover event, SBX computes a factor `beta_q`, based on a random
    number in [0,1) and the distribution index `eta`. This factor dictates where
    each child solution lies relative to the parent solutions. If the parent genes
    (p1 and p2) differ minimally, no crossover is performed (i.e., the children
    inherit the parents' values directly).
