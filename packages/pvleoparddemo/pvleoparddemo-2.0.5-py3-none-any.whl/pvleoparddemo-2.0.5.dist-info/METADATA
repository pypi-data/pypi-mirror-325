## Leopard

Leopard is an on-device speech-to-text engine. Leopard is:

- Private; All voice processing runs locally.
- [Accurate](https://picovoice.ai/docs/benchmark/stt/)
- [Compact and Computationally-Efficient](https://github.com/Picovoice/speech-to-text-benchmark#rtf)
- Cross-Platform:
  - Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x86_64, arm64)
  - Android and iOS
  - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
  - Raspberry Pi (3, 4, 5)

## Compatibility

- Python 3.9+
- Runs on Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), Windows (x86_64, arm64), and Raspberry Pi (3, 4, 5).

## Installation

```console
pip3 install pvleoparddemo
```

## AccessKey

Leopard requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Leopard SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

### File Demo

Run the following in the terminal:

```console
leopard_demo_file --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY} --wav_paths ${AUDIO_FILE_PATH}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console and `${AUDIO_FILE_PATH}` with a path to an audio file you
wish to transcribe.

### Microphone Demo

You need a working microphone connected to your machine for this demo. Run the following in the terminal:

```console
leopard_demo_mic --access_key ${ACCESS_KEY}
```

Replace `${ACCESS_KEY}` with yours obtained from Picovoice Console. Once running, the demo prints:

```console
>>> Press `ENTER` to start:
```

Press `ENTER` key and wait for the following message in the terminal:

```console
>>> Recording ... Press `ENTER` to stop:
```

Now start recording and when done press `ENTER` key to get the transcription.
