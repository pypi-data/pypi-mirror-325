**flimage** is a Python3 library for handling fluorescence data.
Its API is (as much as it makes sense) is identical to that of
`qpimage <https://qpimage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__, making
it a convenient tool for phase- and fluorescence colocalization.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation, including the code reference and examples, is available at
`flimage.readthedocs.io <https://flimage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.


Installation
------------

::

    pip install flimage


Testing
-------

::
