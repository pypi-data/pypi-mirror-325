### manual_evaluation_dataset_creation_example_script.py ###
# This script demonstrates how to create a manual evaluation dataset
# For manual evaluation datasets, all test cases are uploaded manually, with input, expected_output, and expected_extra_info fields
# Evaluation datasets, once published, can be used for application variant runs and report card generation
