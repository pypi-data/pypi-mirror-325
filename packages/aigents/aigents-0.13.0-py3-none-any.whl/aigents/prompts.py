IMPROVE_PROMPT = """###
As an expert prompt engineer, you understand the importance of crafting clear, concise, and effective prompts for ChatGPT. Below are refined guidelines to enhance the quality of your prompts.

Please note: Replace "{text input here}" with the actual text or context you wish to provide.

1. Structure your prompt by placing instructions at the beginning and separating them from the context using ### or triple quotes (\"\"\"):
   - Suboptimal: Summarize the text below as a bullet point list of the most important points.{text input here}
   - Improved: ### Please summarize the following text as a bullet point list of the most important points.Text: \"\"\"{text input here}\"\"\"

2. Specify the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, and any other relevant details:
   - Suboptimal: Write a poem about OpenAI.
   - Improved: ### Write a four-stanza poem about OpenAI's innovative DALL-E product launch, capturing the essence of this text-to-image ML model's capabilities, in the style of {famous poet}.

3. Clearly define the desired output format with examples for better understanding and consistency:
   - Suboptimal: Extract the entities mentioned in the text below. Extract the following 4 entity types: company names, people names, specific topics and themes.Text: {text}
   - Improved: ### Extract the important entities mentioned in the text below. Please categorize them as follows:Company names: -|| People names: -|| Specific topics: -|| General themes: -||Text: \"\"\"{text input here}\"\"\"

4. Use a progression from zero-shot, to few-shot with examples, and then fine-tuning if necessary:
   - Zero-shot: ### Extract keywords from the text below.Text: \"\"\"{text input here}\"\"\"Keywords:
   - Few-shot: ### Extract keywords from the following texts. Here are examples for guidance:Text 1: "Stripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications."Keywords 1: Stripe, APIs, payment processing, web development, websites, mobile applications.Text 2: "OpenAI has developed advanced language models that excel in understanding and generating text. Our API grants access to these models for a wide range of language processing tasks."Keywords 2: OpenAI, language models, understanding, generating text, API.Text 3: \"\"\"{text input here}\"\"\"Keywords 3:

5. Eliminate vague language and be precise in your descriptions:
   - Suboptimal: The description for this product should be fairly short, a few sentences only, and not too much more.
   - Improved: ### Write a concise product description in a single paragraph consisting of 3 to 5 sentences.

6. Focus on what should be done rather than what should not be done:
   - Suboptimal: The following is a conversation between an Agent and a Customer. DO NOT ASK USERNAME OR PASSWORD. DO NOT REPEAT.
   - Improved: ### Conduct a conversation between an Agent and a Customer where the Agent helps diagnose login issues without requesting personal identifiable information (PII) such as usernames or passwords. Instead, guide the Customer to the help article at www.samplewebsite.com/help/faq for further assistance.Customer: "I can't log in to my account."Agent:

7. For code generation, use "leading words" to steer the model towards the desired coding pattern:
   - Suboptimal: # Write a simple python function that asks for a number in miles and converts it to kilometers.
   - Improved: ### Write a simple Python function that performs the following tasks:1. Prompt the user for a number representing miles.2. Convert the miles to kilometers and return the result.Start your function with the necessary imports:import

"""

WEBDESIGN_IMPROVEMENT_INSTRUCTIONS = (
"""
1. Be consistent

You need to be consistent in the placement of functions in the web UI. At the same time, the web UI should work and look the same in all sections of the site. Consistency means that design and functionality remain the same across all your pages and products. Many of the most popular and successful applications and websites use similar patterns for user interfaces across resources, be it the placement of buttons or the way menu systems "flow". The design must be consistent across all publications of the resource. Do not change the fonts of the headings and content on different pages.
2. Simple and clear UI design

The hallmark of a good web user interface is simplicity. We don't mean sticking a button here and there with primitive animations. We are talking about a web user interface that is easy to understand and master, even for a beginner. Users should clearly understand how to get access to this or that functionality. Following this principle implies refining the UX. This increases your viewing time and decreases your bounce rate. One way to achieve clarity is to move from one step to the next on different pages. Offer users the ability to navigate from product page to cart, checkout page, checkout page, the confirmation page. This is especially important for mobile users, as screen space on their devices is limited.
3. Focus on one action at a time

Due to the interactive nature of web design, users often have to perform a lot of interactions. However, this can quickly overwhelm them. This is why we need to focus on one activity at a time. This is especially important when it comes to calls to action. We often bombard users with secondary calls to action when the primary action goes unnoticed. Users cannot perceive that much at a time.
4. Use typography correctly

Another elegant way to create visual hierarchy is typography. It's not as easy as picking a good font. Each font has, so to speak, individuality, and affects the target audience in different ways. Size plays a key role when using fonts on the web. Important information, such as headings, is highlighted in a large and elegant font. And don't forget about contrasts.
5. Simplify forms to fill out

Forms are one of the main methods of user interaction with your web projects. It is there that they will click something, cursing you and the computer from time to time. The problem is that most users hate forms of burning hate. Therefore, your job is to integrate them into your interface as painlessly as possible. So that users do not curse computers and their loved ones more often than necessary. This is not easy to do. In many cases, sites force the user to register for no good reason. If you can skip the form and design an unnecessary interface, that's a win-win scenario.
6: Responsive web design

Responsive design is no longer an option today, it is a necessity. Since users' own phones, their tablets, and their own computers are accessing the Internet, your website and applications need to be accessible and look great at any screen resolution.
7: Before you start designing, draw your ideas

Before designing, you need to draw your own ideas in Photoshop. There are thousands of websites that you can use for inspiration. Therefore, you can explore ideas and create concepts while making them easy to implement, perfect and simplify.
8. Setting goals before designing

Every web user interface should be built to achieve an end goal. From navigation to web forms, all aspects of the user interface should be built to achieve your application goals, whether it is to execute a function or discover something new, as simple as possible and realize it for the user.
9. Implement visual site hierarchy

The most important web UI elements should be highlighted so that users can focus on them. Web UI design has an endless arsenal of tricks for this. The simplest example is to enlarge an element, making it the center of the page. A more original way to implement visual hierarchy is to use a space to highlight important parts of the interface. Alternatively, the appearance of an unexpected tasteful element can work wonders.
10. Use high-quality, professional design software

Many web user interface applications simplify the UI design process but compromise the result. If you design a user interface, software for the mass market or an application that you think has the potential to become popular, you need to use high-quality, professionally designed software. There are many UI design tools available on the internet. But Mockitt is one of the best UI design tools. You can use Mockitt to design web UI.
