"""
This is the main module for creating a web spider 
using the Kryptone framework.

The `MyFirstCrawler` class is a customizable spider for 
crawling and automating  interactions with websites. Follow these 
steps to set up and run your spider:

    1. Specify a list of urls in ``MyFirstCrawler.Meta.start_urls` that
       the spider should visit and gathering additional urls to crawl
    
    2. Define actions to execute on each visited page by overriding 
       the `current_page_actions` method. Optionally, define post-navigation 
       actions that run after each page is visited by overriding the 
       `post_navigation_actions` method
    
    3. Customize the behavior when the spider encounters errors or fails 
       to complete an action by overriding the `after_fail` method

    3. Run the following command to start crawling: `python manage.py start MyFirstCrawler`
