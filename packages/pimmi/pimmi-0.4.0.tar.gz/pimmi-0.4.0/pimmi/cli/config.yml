# Generic parameters
nb_threads:
  value: 8
  help: "Nb. threads used for sift points extraction, index filling and querying. Defaults to 8.
  Set the value according to your CPU core number."

silent:
  value: False

# ==================================================================================================
# Part 1 - SIFT point extraction
sift_resize_image:
  value: True
  help: "Should images be resized to have each dimension less than 'sift_max_image_dimension' before extracting
  sift points. The default sift extraction parameters of Pimmi are set for a 512 pixels max dimension of resized
  images. Defaults to True."

sift_max_image_dimension:
  value: 512
  help: "Max width/heigth if images are resized. Defaults to 512."

sift_nfeatures:
  value: 1000
  help: "OpenCV parameter : the number of best features to retain. The features are ranked by their scores
  (measured in SIFT algorithm as the local contrast).
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html.
  Defaults to 1000 in Pimmi."

sift_nOctaveLayers:
  value: 1
  help: "OpenCV parameter : the number of layers in each octave. 3 is the value used in D. Lowe paper.
  The number of octaves is computed automatically from the image resolution.
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html.
  Defaults to 1 in Pimmi."

sift_contrastThreshold:
  value: 0.1
  help: "OpenCV parameter : the contrast threshold used to filter out weak features in semi-uniform (low-contrast)
  regions. The larger the threshold, the less features are produced by the detector.
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html.
  Defaults to 0.1 in Pimmi."

sift_edgeThreshold:
  value: 10
  help: "OpenCV parameter : the threshold used to filter out edge-like features. Note that its meaning is different from
  the contrastThreshold, i.e. the larger the edgeThreshold, the less features are filtered out
  (more features are retained).
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html.
  Defaults to 10 in Pimmi."

sift_sigma:
  value: 1.6
  help: "OpenCV parameter : the sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the octave #0. If your image
  is captured with a weak camera with soft lenses, you might want to reduce the number.
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d60/classcv_1_1SIFT.html.
  Defaults to 1.6 in Pimmi."


# ==================================================================================================
# Part 2.1 - FAISS index creation
index_type:
  value: "IVF1024,Flat"
  help: "Faiss index type. See all possible values at
  https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Lower-memory-footprint#simplifying-index-construction.
  Defaults to 'IVF1024,Flat', for huge database, you may consider 'OPQ16_64,IVF65536_HNSW32,PQ16'."

index_nb_images_to_train:
  value: 25000
  help: "Max nb. of image used to train the index structure. Defaults to 25000."


# ==================================================================================================
# Part 2.2 - Index querying
query_sift_knn:
  value: 1000
  help: "Nb. of nearest neighbours retrieved for each sift point queried in the index. Defaults to 1000."

query_dist_filter:
  value: True
  help: "Should the nearest neighbours be filtered out if their distance to the query point is greater than the closest
  point distance times the 'query_dist_ratio_threshold'. Simulates an adaptative range query. Defaults to True."

query_dist_ratio_threshold:
  value: 0.6
  help: "See 'query_dist_filter'. Defaults to 0.6."

query_adaptative_sift_knn:
  value: True
  help: "If 'query_dist_filter' is True but no result points have been filtered out (they are all at a distance that is
  close enough to the query point to stay below the 'query_dist_ratio_threshold'), then relaunch a KNN query to retrieve
  more points. This step is done at most 'query_adaptative_knn_max_step' times, multiplying the number of points
  retrieved by 'query_adaptative_knn_mult' each time. Defaults to True."

query_adaptative_knn_mult:
  value: 4
  help: "See 'query_adaptative_sift_knn'. Defaults to 4."

query_adaptative_knn_max_step:
  value: 3
  help: "See 'query_adaptative_sift_knn'. Defaults to 3."

query_match_ratio_filter:
  value: False
  help: "Should the retrieved images be filtered out if the proportion of query points that have matched is less
  than 'query_match_ratio_threshold'. Defaults to False."

query_match_ratio_threshold:
  value: 0.01
  help: "See 'query_match_ratio_filter'. Defaults to 0.01."

query_match_nb_filter:
  value: True
  help: "Should the retrieved images be filtered out if less than 'query_match_nb_threshold' query points
  have matched. Defaults to True."

query_match_nb_threshold:
  value: 5
  help: "See 'query_match_nb_filter'. Defaults to 5."

query_ransac:
  value: True
  help: "Should the geometric consistency of the matched points be assessed by launching the RANSAC algorithm to find
  homography. Currently, only the estimateAffinePartial2D method of OpenCV is used, it estimates an optimal 2D affine
  transformation with 4 degrees of freedom limited to combinations of translation, rotation, and uniform scaling.
  See https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#gad767faff73e9cbd8b9d92b955b50062d.
  Defaults to True."

query_match_nb_ransac_filter:
  value: True
  help: "Should the retrieved images be filtered out if less than 'query_match_nb_ransac_threshold' query points
  are still have matching after the geometric consistency is enforced. Defaults to True."

query_match_nb_ransac_threshold:
  value: 5
  help: "See 'query_match_nb_ransac_filter'. Defaults to 5."

query_remove_from_results:

  have matched. Defaults to 10"

algo:
  value: "components"
  help: "Method used to detect communities in the image similarity graph. Use 'components' for connected components,
  and 'louvain' for multi-level modularity optimization (Blondel, V. D., Guillaume, J.-L., Lambiotte, R., &
  Lefebvre, E. (2008))"
