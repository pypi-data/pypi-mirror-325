Welcome to the lollms_client repository! This library is built by [ParisNeo](https://github.com/ParisNeo) and provides a convenient way to interact with the lollms (Lord Of Large Language Models) API. It is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lollms-client/) and distributed under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Installation

To install the library from PyPI using `pip`, run:

```
pip install lollms-client
``` 

## Usage

To use the lollms_client, first import the necessary classes:

```python
from lollms_client import LollmsClient

# Initialize the LollmsClient instance this uses the default lollms localhost service http://localhost:9600
lc = LollmsClient()
# You can also use a different host and port number if you please
lc = LollmsClient("http://some.other.server:9600")
# You can also use a local or remote ollama server
lc = LollmsClient(model_name="mistral-nemo:latest", default_generation_mode = ELF_GENERATION_FORMAT.OLLAMA)
# You can also use a local or remote openai server (you can either set your key as an environment variable or pass it here)
lc = LollmsClient(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", default_generation_mode = ELF_GENERATION_FORMAT.OPENAI)
```

### Text Generation

Use `generate()` for generating text from the lollms API.

```python
response = lc.generate(prompt="Once upon a time", stream=False, temperature=0.5)
print(response)
```


### List Mounted Personalities (only on lollms)

List mounted personalities of the lollms API with the `listMountedPersonalities()` method.

```python
response = lc.listMountedPersonalities()
print(response)
```

### List Models

List available models of the lollms API with the `listModels()` method.

```python
response = lc.listModels()
print(response)
```

## Complete Example

```python
from lollms_client import LollmsClient

# Initialize the LollmsClient instance
lc = LollmsClient()

# Generate Text
response = lc.generate(prompt="Once upon a time", stream=False, temperature=0.5)
print(response)

# List Mounted Personalities
response = lc.listMountedPersonalities()
print(response)

# List Models
response = lc.listModels()
print(response)
```
