    Robust Empirical Mode Decomposition
    A useful adaptive signal processing tool for multi-component signal separation, non-stationary signal processing.

    The REMD is an improved empirical mode decomposition powered by soft sifting stopping criterion (SSSC).
    The SSSC is an adaptive sifting stop criterion to stop the sifting process automatically for the EMD.
    It extracts a set of mono-component signals (called intrinsic mode functions) from a temporal mixed signal.
    It can be used together with Hilbert transform (or other demodulation techniques) for advanced time-frequency analysis.
