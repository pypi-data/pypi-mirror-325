The agent requested to execute the following functions, with the results as follows:
{% for tool in tools %}
- {{ tool.name }}({{ tool.params }})
Here is the feedback from the supervisor:
{{ tool.explanations }}
{% endfor %}

As one of them rejected, the agent was not able to execute the function.

This is not a message from the user but from a supervisor system that is helping the agent to improve its behavior. You should try something else!
