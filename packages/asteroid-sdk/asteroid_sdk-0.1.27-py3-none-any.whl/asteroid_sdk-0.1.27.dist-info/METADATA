# Asteroid Python SDK ☄️
A Python SDK for interacting with the Asteroid platform. To successfully use Asteroid Python SDK, you need to have a running instance of the Asteroid server. [Book a demo]( https://calendly.com/founders-asteroid-hhaf/30min) with Asteroid founders to get started!


## Installation
```bash
pip install asteroid-sdk
```

## Quick Start
```python
from asteroid_sdk.wrappers.openai import asteroid_openai_client
from asteroid_sdk.registration.initialise_project import asteroid_init
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.decorators import supervise
from asteroid_sdk.supervision.base_supervisors import llm_supervisor, human_supervisor
from openai import OpenAI

# Define your tools with supervisors
@supervise(supervision_functions=[
    [llm_supervisor(instructions="For flights above $1000, escalate."), human_supervisor()]])
def book_flight(departure_city: str, arrival_city: str, datetime: str):
    """Book a flight ticket."""
    return f"Flight booked from {departure_city} to {arrival_city} on {datetime}."

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "book_flight",
        "description": "Book a flight ticket.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "departure_city": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "arrival_city": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "datetime": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "departure_city",
                "arrival_city",
                "datetime"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": False
        },
        "strict": True
    }
}]

# Initialize the SDK
run_id = asteroid_init()

# Wrap your LLM client
client = OpenAI()
wrapped_client = asteroid_openai_client(client, run_id)

# Run your LLM
response = wrapped_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Book a flight from SF to LA for tomorrow for $1100."}],
    tools=tools
)
# The response is supervised by Asteroid, check the web UI for the results and human review
```
