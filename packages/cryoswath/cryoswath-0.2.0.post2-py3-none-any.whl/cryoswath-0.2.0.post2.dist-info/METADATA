cryoswath is a python package containing processing pipelines, a tool
library, and some pre-assembled data to retrieve and study CryoSat-2
data.

Adaptability lies at its core. The user can access many options simply
by passing arguments to functions; everything else can be customized
changing the concerned function or adding a new one.

## üå± state

cryoswath is being developed. `main` contains those parts that I
believe to work if used as intended and that are tested to some
extent. Other branches are for development.

## ‚ú® features

- find all CryoSat-2 tracks passing over your region of interest
- download L1b data from ESA
- retrieve swath elevation estimates
- aggregate point data to gridded data
- fill data gaps using tested methods
- calculate change rates

## üöÄ getting started

To use cryoswath, pull this repo and download ArcticDEM and the RGI
glacier and complex shape files into the `data/auxiliary/DEM` and -`RGI`
directories. Then, either use the provided docker container or set up an
environment and install the software dependencies.

### with conda üêç

1. `conda create --name env_name --file <base dir>/docker/conda_requirements.txt`
2. `conda activate env_name`

### with Docker üê≥

1. `docker run --detach --interactive --volume <base dir>:/altimetry_project cryoswath/cryoswath:nightly`
2. connect with your favorite IDE or `docker exec --interactive <container hash> sh`

## üìñ documentation

[j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath](https://j-haacker.github.io/cryoswath/)

## dependencies

- [requirements.txt](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/blob/main/requirements.txt)
- reference elevation model
- glacier outlines

cryoswath will point you to the required resources.

## üêõ known issues

- projected RGI basins sometimes "invalid"
    -> add `.make_valid()` if it is missing somewhere
- it has mostly been tested for the Arctic

  Further: see [open issues](https://github.com/j-haacker/cryoswath/issues).
