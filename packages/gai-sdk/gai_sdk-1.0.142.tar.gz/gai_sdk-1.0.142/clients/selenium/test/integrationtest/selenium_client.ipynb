      "                                15 September 2023 There are many dishes that are very much representative of Singapore, and one of the most iconic of them is, of course, chicken rice. Loosely referred to as Singapore's national dish, the ubiquitous Hainanese chicken rice requires a meticulous preparation process. To make this classic chicken rice dish, the chicken is first scalded until cooked through before it is dipped in ice-cold water to keep the meat soft and tender. Served with chicken broth, ginger sauce, black soy sauce, and chilli, the highlight is the rice that has been cooked with the chicken's oils. The end-product may look deceptively simple, but it is very delicious. Singapore's offerings also go beyond the traditional Hainanese chicken rice. There is also kampung -style chicken rice where the poultry used is leaner. Soya sauce chicken rice is also a popular choice, as well as salt-baked chicken. With the diversity presented in a single dish, Singapore's chicken rice definitely draws in curious diners to uncover more of the Lion City's chicken rice culture. Being equally fascinated with Singapore's chicken rice, the MICHELIN Guide inspectors share with us where to get the best ones in Singapore, so read on below!
