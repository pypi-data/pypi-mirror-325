**Niquests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. It
is designed to be a drop-in replacement for **Requests** that is no longer under feature freeze.

-------------------

**Behold, the power of Niquests**::

   >>> import niquests
   >>> s = niquests.Session(resolver="doh+google://", multiplexed=True)
   >>> r = s.get('https://pie.dev/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
   >>> r.status_code
   200
   >>> r.headers['content-type']
   'application/json; charset=utf8'
   >>> r.oheaders.content_type.charset
   'utf8'
   >>> r.encoding
   'utf-8'
   >>> r.text
   '{"authenticated": true, ...'
   >>> r.json()
   {'authenticated': True, ...}
   >>> r
   <Response HTTP/3 [200]>
   >>> r.ocsp_verified
   True
   >>> r.conn_info.established_latency
   datetime.timedelta(microseconds=38)

See `similar code, sans Niquests <https://gist.github.com/973705>`_.


**Niquests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 requests extremely easily.
There's no need to manually add query strings to your
URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling
are 100% automatic, thanks to `urllib3.future <https://github.com/jawah/urllib3.future>`_.
