# Kleinkram: CLI

Install the package

```bash
pip install kleinkram
```

Run the CLI

```bash
klein
```

## Usage

Here are some basic examples of how to use the CLI.

### Listing Files

To list all files in a mission:

```bash
klein list -p project-name -m mission-name
```

### Uploading Files

To upload all `*.bag` files in the current directory to a mission:

```bash
klein upload -p project-name -m mission-name *.bag
```

If you would like to create a new mission on upload use the `--create` flag.

### Downloading Files

To download all files from a mission and save them `out`:

```bash
klein download -p project-name -m mission-name --dest out
```

You can additionally specify filenames or ids if you only want to download specific files.

Instead of downloading files from a specified mission you can download arbitrary files by specifying their ids:

```bash
klein download --dest out *id1* *id2* *id3*
```
