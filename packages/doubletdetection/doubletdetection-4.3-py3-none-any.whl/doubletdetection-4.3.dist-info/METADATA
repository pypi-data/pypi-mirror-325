DoubletDetection is a Python3 package to detect doublets (technical errors) in single-cell RNA-seq count matrices.

## Installing DoubletDetection

Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install doubletdetection
```

Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonathanShor/DoubletDetection.git
cd DoubletDetection
pip3 install .
```

If you are using `pipenv` as your virtual environment, it may struggle installing from the setup.py due to our custom Phenograph requirement.
If so, try the following in the cloned repo:

```bash
pipenv run pip3 install .
```

## Running DoubletDetection

To run basic doublet classification:

```Python
import doubletdetection
clf = doubletdetection.BoostClassifier()
# raw_counts is a cells by genes count matrix
labels = clf.fit(raw_counts).predict()
# higher means more likely to be doublet
scores = clf.doublet_score()
```

- `raw_counts` is a scRNA-seq count matrix (cells by genes), and is array-like
- `labels` is a 1-dimensional numpy ndarray with the value 1 representing a detected doublet, 0 a singlet, and `np.nan` an ambiguous cell.
- `scores` is a 1-dimensional numpy ndarray representing a score for how likely a cell is to be a doublet. The score is used to create the labels.

The classifier works best when

- There are several cell types present in the data
- It is applied individually to each run in an aggregated count matrix

In `v2.5` we have added a new experimental clustering method (`scanpy`'s Louvain clustering) that is much faster than phenograph. We are still validating results from this new clustering. Please see the notebook below for an example of using this new feature.

## Tutorial

See our [tutorial](https://doubletdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for an example on 10k PBMCs from 10x Genomics.
