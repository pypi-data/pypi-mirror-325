"""Integration with the [fsspec] library.

[fsspec]: https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec

The fsspec integration is **best effort** and not the primary API of `obstore`. This integration may not be as stable and may not provide the same performance as the rest of the library. Changes may be made even in patch releases to align better with fsspec expectations. If you find any bugs, please [file an issue](https://github.com/developmentseed/obstore/issues/new/choose).

The underlying `object_store` Rust crate [cautions](https://docs.rs/object_store/latest/object_store/#why-not-a-filesystem-interface) against relying too strongly on stateful filesystem representations of object stores:

> The ObjectStore interface is designed to mirror the APIs of object stores and not filesystems, and thus has stateless APIs instead of cursor based interfaces such as Read or Seek available in filesystems.
>
> This design provides the following advantages:
>
> - All operations are atomic, and readers cannot observe partial and/or failed writes
> - Methods map directly to object store APIs, providing both efficiency and predictability
> - Abstracts away filesystem and operating system specific quirks, ensuring portability
> - Allows for functionality not native to filesystems, such as operation preconditions and atomic multipart uploads

Where possible, implementations should use the underlying `obstore` APIs
directly. Only where this is not possible should users fall back to this fsspec
integration.

            asynchronous: Set to `True` if this instance is meant to be be called using
                the fsspec async API. This should only be set to true when running
                within a coroutine.
