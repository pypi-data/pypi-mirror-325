from sphinx(1) into X11 applications
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
type-pwd username hostname
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This tool builds on \f[V]type-pwd(1)\f[R], it uses \f[V]dmenu(1)\f[R] in
order to query a hostname, then depending if only one or more usernames
are known by the oracle - if only one then the next step is skipped:
provides a choice which username to use.
Then \f[V]type-pwd(1)\f[R] is invoked using the selected user and
hostname.
.PP
This tool cashes the hostnames it was used with in the file
\f[V]\[ti]/.sphinx-hosts\f[R].
