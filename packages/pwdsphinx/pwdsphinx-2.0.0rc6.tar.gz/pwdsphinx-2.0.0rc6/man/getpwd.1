getpwd - simple tool that queries a password from a user and writes it
to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[C]
getpwd [\[dq]prompt\[dq]] | sphinx get username hostname
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a simple script which uses \f[V]pinentry\f[R] from the gnupg
project to query a password and write it out to standard output.
Which \f[V]pinentry\f[R] variant you use, is up to you, it can be a
curses, gtk or qt interface.
This should be safer than echoing a password into pwdsphinx, since your
password will not show up in your process list nor your command line
history.
.PP
The only parameter this tool takes is a prompt to display when asking
for the password.
