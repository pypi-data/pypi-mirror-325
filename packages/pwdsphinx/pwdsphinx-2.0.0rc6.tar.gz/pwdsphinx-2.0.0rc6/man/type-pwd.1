type-pwd - tool which wraps sphinx(1) to get and type a password to an
X11 application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
type-pwd username hostname
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script combines \f[V]getpwd(1)\f[R], \f[V]exec-on-click(1)\f[R] and
the \f[V]sphinx(1)\f[R] client in such a way, that it securely queries
for your master password, and then waits until you click somewhere
(hopefully into a password entry field) and then sends the password as
keystrokes.
Using this mechanism you make sure your password is never on your
clipboard where malware might steal it.
And also it allows you to enter your password on those sites that
disable copy/pasting into password fields.
.PP
When you click make sure you click in the password entry field where you
want the password to be entered.
