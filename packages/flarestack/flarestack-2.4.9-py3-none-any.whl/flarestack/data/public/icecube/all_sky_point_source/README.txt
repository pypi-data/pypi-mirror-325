These public IceCube datasets can be found in the IceCube website at:

    https://icecube.wisc.edu/science/data/PS-3years

They can be used for point source analysis.

The mapping between energy proxy and true energy was also released by IceCube at:

    https://icecube.wisc.edu/science/data/TXS0506_point_source

These were released for the analysis of TXS 0506+056, but are roughly right for other cases.
