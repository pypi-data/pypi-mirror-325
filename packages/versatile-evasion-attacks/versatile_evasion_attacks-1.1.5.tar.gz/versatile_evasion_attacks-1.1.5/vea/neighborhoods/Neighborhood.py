"""
Abstract class for all neighborhood classes to come.
- All neighborhoods take as input a dictionary of constrains:
    { "equality": ["x[0] = int(x[0])", ...],
      "inequality": ["x[1] > x[2]**2", ...],
      "clip_min": [0, None, ...], # minimum values for each feature, this list is the size of the input x
      "clip_max": [1, None, ...], # maximum values for each feature
      "categorical": [None, [0, 1], ...], # categorical features
    }
- All neighborhoods must contain a "generate" method for generating a neighborhood of a given input.
- All neighborhoods use the original input x to generate one or more samples.
