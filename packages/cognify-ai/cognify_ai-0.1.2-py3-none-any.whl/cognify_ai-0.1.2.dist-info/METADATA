            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
        
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and
        
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and
        
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
        
          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
          APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# Automated, Multi-Faceted Gen-AI Workflow Optimization

Building high-quality, cost-effective generative-AI (gen-AI) applications is challenging due to the absence of systematic methods for tuning, testing, and optimizing them. 
We introduce **Cognify**, a tool that automatically enhances generation quality and reduces costs for gen-AI workflows, including those written with LangChain, DSPy, and annotated Python. 
Built on a novel foundation of hierarchical, workflow-level optimization, **Cognify** improves gen-AI workflow generation quality by up to 48% and reduces their execution cost by up to 9 times. 
Read more about **Cognify** [here](https://mlsys.wuklab.io/posts/cognify/).

## Installation

Cognify is available as a Python package and can be installed as
```
pip install cognify-ai
```

Or install from the source:
```
git clone https://github.com/GenseeAI/cognify
cd cognify
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

You can use Cognify with our simple CLI:
```bash
cognify optimize /your/gen/ai/workflow.py   
```
where `workflow.py` is your workflow source code. Cognify currently supports unmodified [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) and [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) workflow source code. You can also port your existing workflow written directly on Python or develop new Python-based workflows with our [simple workflow interface](https://cognify-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials/interface/program.html).

Cognify automatically searches for a `config.py` in the same folder as the workflow. You can also specify this file explicitly by:
```bash
cognify optimize /your/gen/ai/workflow.py -c /your/gen/ai/custom_config.py
```

Within the `config.py`, you should define the following:

- **Sample Dataset**: Cognify relies on training data to evaluate and improve its workflow optimization. You should provide a data loader that loads your training dataset in the form of input-output pairs. Read more about how to [load your data](https://cognify-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials/dataloader.html).
- **Evaluator**: Cognify expects you to provide an evaluator for judging the final workflow generation's quality. To help you get started, Cognify provides several common evaluator implementations such as the F1 score. Find out more about [workflow evaluator](https://cognify-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials/evaluator.html).
- **Optimization Configurations and Model Set Selection**: Optionally, you can configure your optimization process in various ways. For example, you can choose between light, medium, or heavy search over the optimization space. We also provide a few domain-specific optimization configurations. You can also define the set of models you want Cognify to explore. If no configurations or models are provided, Cognify uses a default set of values. Read more about [optimization configurations and model selections](https://cognify-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorials/optimizer.html).

With these parameters, Cognify optimizes your workflow by iteratively experimenting with various combinations of tuning methods (we call them “*cogs*”) applied across workflow components and assessing the effectiveness of these combinations based on the quality of the final output using the user-provided sample dataset and evaluator. This process continues until Cognify hits the user-specified maximum iteration numbers (in `config.py`).

The result of this process is a set of optimized workflow versions with different quality-cost combinations on the [Pareto frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) among all the iterations.
You can inspect the optimizations applied in these output files 
You can evaluate these optimized versions with a test dataset:

```bash
cognify evaluate /your/gen/ai/workflow/optimization/output/path
```

You can also continue running Cognify with more iterations from these outputs using the `-r` or `--resume` flag:

```bash
cognify optimize /your/gen/ai/workflow.py -r
```
