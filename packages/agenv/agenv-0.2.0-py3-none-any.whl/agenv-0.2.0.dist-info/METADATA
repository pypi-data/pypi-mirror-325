# agenv

A simple Python package for securely loading environment variables from age encrypted file.

## Installation

```sh
pip install agenv
```

> [!NOTE]
> [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#installation) must be installed separately, as there is no native Python implementation of age.

## Usage

```python
from agenv import load_age_env

load_age_env(".env.age")  # Decrypts and loads environment variables
```

### Identity Key Selection Order

agenv determines the age identity key in the following order:

1. The `identity` parameter provided to `load_age_env()`
2. The `AGE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
3. The `AGE_SECRET_KEY_FILE` environment variable (path to key file)
4. The default key file: `~/.age/key`

If no valid identity is found, decryption will fail.
