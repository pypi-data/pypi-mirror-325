    """
    TODO: do this perfect idea!

    smth like BS4 syntax but for dict/list
    1. use full access WR work with any level
    2. dict/list - ok! tuple - as generic final!
    3. keep source link! not just a simple copy (like in DictDots)!

    WHY NOT - DictDots
    ------------------
    it was a simple way to work with mainly first level! and only with dict!
    it seems it is obviously need use with lists same!
