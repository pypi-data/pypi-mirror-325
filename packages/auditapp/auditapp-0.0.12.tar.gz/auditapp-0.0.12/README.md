## Summary

AUDIT, Analysis & evalUation Dashboard of artIficial inTelligence, is a tool designed to analyze,
visualize, and detect biases in brain MRI data and models. It provides tools for loading and processing MRI data,
extracting relevant features, and visualizing model performance and biases in predictions. AUDIT presents the 
following features:


- **Data management**: Easily work and preprocess MRIs from various sources.
- **Feature extraction**: Extract relevant features from the images and their segmentations for analysis.
- **Model robustness**: Assess model generalization by evaluating its performance across several experiments
                        and conditions.
- **Bias detection**: Identify potential biases either in model predictions and performance or on your data.
- **Longitudinal analysis**: Track the model performance over different time points.
- **High compatibility**: Provides connection with tools like ITK-SNAP and other external tools.

Details of our work are provided in [*our paper*](...........), **AUDIT**. We hope that 
users will use *AUDIT* to gain novel insights into brain tumor segmentation field. 


## Usage
- **Home Page**: The main landing page of the tool.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Exploration of individual variables to understand their distributions and discover
                           outliers in it.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Examination of multiple variables simultaneously to explore relationships and
                             hidden patterns.
- **Segmentation Error Matrix**: A pseudo-confusion matrix displaying the errors associated with the
                                 segmentation tasks.
- **Model Performance Analysis**: Evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy of a single model.
- **Pairwise Model Performance Comparison**: Perform pair-wise comparisons between models to find statistical
                                             significant differences.
- **Multi-model Performance Comparison**: Comparative analysis of performance metrics across multiple models.
- **Longitudinal Measurements**: Analysis of data collected over time to observe trends and changes on model
                                 accuracy.
- **Subjects Exploration**: Detailed examination of individual subjects within the dataset.

    model_M: "${datasets_path}/dataset_N/dataset_N_seg/model_M"
```
</details>


### 3. Run AUDIT backend

Use the following commands to run the *Feature extraction* and *Metric extraction* scripts:

```bash
python src/audit/feature_extraction.py
```

```bash
python src/audit/metric_extraction.py
```

A _logs_ folder will be created after running each of the scripts to keep track of the execution. All the output files 
will be stored in the folder defined in the corresponding config file (by default in the _output_ folder).

### 4. Run AUDIT app

Use the following streamlit command to run the APP and start the data exploration:

```bash
python python src/audit/app/launcher.py
```

### 5. Additional configurations

#### 5.1. ITK-Snap

AUDIT is prepared for opening cases with ITK-Snap while exploring the data in the different dashboards. However, the 
ITK-Snap tool must have been installed and preconfigured before. Here we provide a simple necessary configuration to 
use it in each operative system:

<details>
  <summary><strong>5.1.1. On Mac OS</strong></summary>

```bash
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary><strong>5.1.2. On Linux OS</strong></summary>

```bash
```
</details>
