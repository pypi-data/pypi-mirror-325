# herding
Kernel herding is a kind of quasi-monte carlo where samples are chosen successively to approximate known kernel moment constraints. 

In the [video](https://github.com/microprediction/herding/tree/main/docs/assets/video) also linked below, the green dots are landmark locations `y` and the expected value of a gaussian kernel `E[ker(x,y)]` is assumed known for the desired distribution for `x`, which happens to be Gaussian.   

See [examples](https://github.com/microprediction/herding/tree/main/examples)
