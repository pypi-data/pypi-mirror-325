# Stock Analysis Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract relevant stock information from the Stock Analysis website. It utilizes `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML content and extract specific data points, such as market capitalization, revenue, industry, sector, and more. Additionally, it can extract pre-market gainers, after-hours gainers, and all news articles related to stocks.

    -   Market Capitalization
    -   Revenue (TTM)
    -   Net Income (TTM)

    -   **Pre-Market Gainers**: Stocks with the highest gains during pre-market trading.
    -   **After-Hours Gainers**: Stocks with the highest gains during after-hours trading.
    -   **All News**: Recent news articles related to the stock market and specific stocks.
-   Outputs the extracted data as a dictionary for easy integration with other applications or storage solutions.
