This Python library is a high-level set of Kubernetes Helpers allowing either
to manage individual standard Kubernetes controllers (Deployment, StatefulSets, etc) or a logical set
of standard Kubernetes controllers through the `expecteddeploymentscales.wiremind.io` CRD (for example
allowing to scale down ALL Deployments of a Helm Release marked as such).
