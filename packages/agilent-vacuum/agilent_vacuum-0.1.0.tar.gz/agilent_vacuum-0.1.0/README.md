# Agilent-Vacuum
A collection of classes for communication with various Agilent Vacuum pump controllers.

This package supports:
* Agilent TwissTorr 74FS Rack Turbo Pump controller 
* Agilent IPCMini Ion Pump Controller

* This is was developed for internal use at Luxbright.

This is used 24/7 in production lines and R&D labs since year 2023.
But we only use a subset of all implemented commands and not all commands are tested by the pytest suite.

I hope that it can be useful as it is, or as source of inspiration for somebudy else.
This is not an official library from Agilent and we are not associated with the, 
we are only a user of their products.
