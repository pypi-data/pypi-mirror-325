# Power Grid Model Data Science (DS)

The Power Grid Model DS project extends the capabilities of the `power-grid-model` calculation core with a modelling and simulation interface. This is aimed at building data science software applications related to or using the power-grid-model project. It defines a `Grid` dataclass which manages the consistency of the complete network.

Some highlighted features:

- Using a model definition that corresponds to the power-grid-model, through
  which it is easy to do efficient grid calculations.
- The extended numpy model provides features which make development more
  pleasant and easy.
- Using the graph representation of the network, graph algorithms in rustworkx
  can be used to analyze the network.
- An interface to model network mutations which is useful in
  simulation use-cases.

See the [power-grid-model-ds documentation](https://power-grid-model-ds.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information.
