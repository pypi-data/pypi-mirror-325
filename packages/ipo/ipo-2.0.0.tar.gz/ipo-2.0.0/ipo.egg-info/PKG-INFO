ipo: Infix piping operator

## Demo
```python
from ipo import ipo, opi, head, write, p

# Ipo makes data flows much easier to follow.
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | sorted                     | opi  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Ipo comes with a shorthand for partial application:
#   p(head)(3) is equivalent to functools.partial(head, 3)
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | p(head)(3)          | list | opi  # [5, 2, 3]
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | p(head)(3) | sorted        | opi  # [2, 3, 5]
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | sorted | p(head)(3) | list | opi  # [1, 2, 3]
# Much more readable than the original!
#   list(itertools.islice(sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]), 3))

# You can also pipe to print directly…
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | sorted | p(head)(3) | list | print  # [1, 2, 3]
# …or to ipo's write, which prints each line of an iterable on its own line.
ipo([5, 2, 3, 1, 4]) | sorted | p(head)(3) | list | write  # 1\n2\n3
```

```python
from itertools import starmap
from ipo import from_csv, skip, to_csv, before, write, p

# Ipo is ideally suited for working with CSV data.
ipo("""
#Voltage,Current
12,1
8,2
220,6
""".strip().split()) | from_csv | p(skip)(1) | \
	p(starmap)(lambda v, a: (v, a, float(v) * float(a))) | \
	to_csv | p(before)(["#Voltage,Current,Power"]) | write
# #Voltage,Current,Power
# 12,1,12.0
# 8,2,16.0
# 220,6,1320.0
```

```python
from ipo import read, write, p

# Most ipo chains that work over iterable data are lazy by default. You can load huge files,
# process them and write the results to another file.
with open("bigfile.txt") as f_in, open("processed.txt") as f_out:
	read(file=f_in) | p(map)(some_preprocessing) | \
	p(map)(some_advanced_function) | \
	p(map)(some_formatting) | p(write)(file=f_out)
```
