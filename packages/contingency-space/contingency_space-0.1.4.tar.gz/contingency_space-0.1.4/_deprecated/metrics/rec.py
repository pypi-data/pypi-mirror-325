        Calculates the Recall based on the true classes and the predicted ones. The
        formula for Recall is:

        .. math::

            PRE = TP / (TP + FN)

        :param cm: an instance of a confusion matrix for which value is required.
        :param average: default is `None` for binary case. The other two options are `micro` and
        `macro`. When `micro` is used, we get the total_tp, total_fp, and total_fn from
        `CMGeneralized` and then using the above formula, calculate `micor_recall`. When
        `macro` is used, first per-class recall is calculated; for i-th class, i-th entry on
        diagonal divided by the sum of i-th row. Then, the average of those recalls will be
        returned as the `macro_recall`.

        Note: When using 'micro', total_fp is equal to total_fn, thus pre = rec = f1score = acc.
        Note: Only when `CMGeneralized` is used, `average` would be effective.
