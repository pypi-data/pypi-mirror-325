            Error! The original (non-normalized) confusion matrices are needed.
            
            Normalization is a lossy process: a normalized confusion matrix represents infinitely many
            (non-identical) confusion matrices. This makes a metric to return the same value for originally different
            confusion matrices. For measuring the 2D and 3D distances between two confusion matrices, however, the
            confusion matrices may be internally normalized using the optional argument `normalize`.
