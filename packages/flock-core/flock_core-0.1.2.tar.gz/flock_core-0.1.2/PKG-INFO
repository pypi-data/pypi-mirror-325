## Hello, Bot

```python
MODEL = "openai/gpt-4o"

async def main():
 
    #--------------------------------
    # Create the flock
    #--------------------------------
    # The flock is the place where all the agents are at home
    flock = Flock(model=MODEL)

    #--------------------------------
    # Create an agent
    #--------------------------------
    # The flock doesn't believe in prompts (continue reading for more info)
    # The flock just declares what agents get in and what agents produce
    # bloggy takes in a blog_idea and outputs a funny_blog_title and blog_headers
    bloggy = Flock(
        DeclarativeAgent,
        name="bloggy",
        input="blog_idea",
        output="funny_blog_title, blog_headers"  
    )

    #--------------------------------
    # Let the flock do its thing
    #--------------------------------
    # By giving the flock a start_agent and an input, we can run the flock
    # local_debug makes it easier to debug the flock
    result = await flock.run_async(
        context=context,
        start_agent=bloggy,
        input="a blog about cats",
        local_debug=True
    )
    # earn the fruits of the flock's labor
    print(result)


    # Continue reading to give your flock temporal(ly) super powers, heh.

```

Problems with other agent frameworks

- Instead of writing software you need to write pages long natural language prompts
- One crash and your whole agent system is dead
- Demand having your system be a real DAG and a real state machine

How flock tries to solve it:

- Just declare what your agents get ind, and what they should return
- First grade temporalio support. Retry, Error, Timeout etc etc are somethi
- Chain your agents together in any kind you want

## Philosophy & Design Principles

### Say goodbye to prompting

Sometimes you see agents with a 200 lines of text system prompt.
How do evaluate if this is the most optimal prompt for your use case? How would changes affect the performance?
Questions for there is no easy answer.

How does a good prompt look like? What happens with your prompt if you switch models?

With flock you just tell an agent what kind of input it gets, and what it should output. Done. Easy peasy.

The philosophy behind this approach is simple: by focusing on the interface (inputs and outputs) rather than implementation details (prompts), we create more maintainable and adaptable systems. This declarative approach means:

- Your agents are model-agnostic
- Behavior can be tested and validated objectively
- Changes are localized and predictable
- Integration with other systems becomes straightforward

### Testable

Reducing the need for fuzzy natural language to a minimum agents become easily testable, evaluable.
flock comes with tools to know exactly how good your agents and therefore the agent system is performing.

This focus on testability isn't just about catching bugs - it's about building confidence in your AI systems:

- Clear input/output contracts make unit testing straightforward
- Type safety ensures data consistency
- Performance metrics are built into the framework
- Behavior can be validated systematically

### Production ready

Would you run your agent system in critical environments? The answer is probably no, since with most frameworks one dead endpoint or uncatched exception will break the whole agent system.

flock uses Temporal as its workflow engine which comes with battle-hardened retry, failure, exception options.

This production-readiness is achieved through several key design decisions:

- Temporal workflow engine for durability and reliability
- Strong typing for predictable behavior
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities

## Core Features

- **Declarative Agent System**: Define agents with clear input/output specifications and optional tool capabilities
- **Temporal Workflow Integration**: Built-in support for durable execution and state management using Temporal
- **Tool Integration**: Easy integration of external tools like web search, code evaluation, and math computation
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing support for agent inputs and outputs
- **DSPy Integration**: Seamless integration with DSPy for LLM interactions
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for agent chaining, hand-offs, and complex workflows

## Architecture and Flow

## Requirements

Nothing. Temporal is not needed for development but recommended

Either clone <https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose> and up the compose

or install the temporal cli

<https://docs.temporal.io/cli>

## Installation

```bash
pip install flock
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of creating and using an agent:

```python
import asyncio
from flock.core.agents.declarative_agent import DeclarativeAgent
from flock.core.flock import flock

async def main():
    # Initialize flock
    agent_runner = flock()

    # Create a simple agent
    agent = DeclarativeAgent(
        name="blog_title_agent",
        input="blog_idea",
        output="funny_blog_title",
    )
    agent_runner.add_agent(agent)

    # Run the agent
    result = await agent_runner.run_async(
        start_agent=agent,
        input="a blog about cats",
        local_debug=True,
    )
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Web Application

flock comes with a built-in web interface for managing and monitoring your agents. The web app provides a rich, interactive environment for working with your agent systems.

## Advanced Usage

### Agents with Tools

Agents can use tools to interact with external systems:

```python
from flock.core.tools import basic_tools

agent = DeclarativeAgent(
    name="research_agent",
    input="research_topic",
    output="research_result",
    tools=[basic_tools.web_search_tavily],
)
```

### Type-Safe Outputs

Define complex output types for structured responses:

```python
agent = DeclarativeAgent(
    name="analysis_agent",
    input="long_text",
    output="""
        title: str,
        headings: list[str],
        entities_and_metadata: list[dict[str, str]],
        type: Literal['news', 'blog', 'opinion piece', 'tweet']
    """,
)
```

### Agent Chaining

Create chains of agents that can hand off tasks:

```python
# First agent in chain
project_plan_agent = DeclarativeAgent(
    name="project_plan_agent",
    input="project_idea",
    output="catchy_project_name, project_pitch, project_plan_headings: list[str]",
    tools=[basic_tools.web_search_tavily, basic_tools.code_eval],
)

# Second agent in chain
content_agent = DeclarativeAgent(
    name="content_agent",
    input="context,project_plan_agent.project_plan_headings.items",
    output="project_plan_heading, project_plan_content_for_heading",
)

# Set up hand-off
project_plan_agent.hand_off = content_agent
```

## Evolution & Future Direction

flock was born from the realization that current agent frameworks often prioritize flexibility at the cost of reliability and maintainability. The framework's design decisions reflect this focus:

### Why Declarative?

The declarative approach wasn't just a stylistic choice - it was a deliberate decision to separate what agents do from how they do it. This separation means:

- Agents can be optimized independently of their interface
- Different LLM backends can be swapped without changing agent definitions
- Testing and validation become straightforward
- Integration with existing systems is simplified

### Why Temporal?

Using Temporal as the workflow engine was crucial for production reliability:

- Automatic retry on failures
- Built-in state management
- Scalable execution
- Detailed execution history
- Production-grade monitoring

### Future Plans

The framework is actively evolving with several key areas of focus:

- Enhanced type system for more complex agent interactions
- Expanded tool ecosystem
- Improved optimization capabilities
- Advanced monitoring and debugging features
- Extended testing and validation tools
