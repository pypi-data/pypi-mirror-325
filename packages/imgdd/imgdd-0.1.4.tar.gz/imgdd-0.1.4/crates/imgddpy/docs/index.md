# imgdd: Image DeDuplication

`imgdd` is a performance-first perceptual hashing library that combines Rust's speed with Python's accessibility, making it perfect for handling large datasets. Designed to quickly process nested folder structures, commonly found in image datasets.

## Features
- **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**: Supports `aHash`, `dHash`, `mHash`, `pHash`, `wHash`.
- **Multiple Filter Types**: Supports `Nearest`, `Triangle`, `CatmullRom`, `Gaussian`, `Lanczos3`.
- **Identify Duplicates**: Quickly identify duplicate hash pairs.
- **Simplicity**: Simple interface, robust performance.

## Why imgdd?

`imgdd` has been inspired by [imagehash](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash) and aims to be a lightning-fast replacement with additional features. To ensure enhanced performance, `imgdd` has been benchmarked against `imagehash`. In Python, **imgdd consistently outperforms imagehash by ~60%â€“95%**, demonstrating a significant reduction in hashing time per image.
