Usage
-----

1. First you need an AWS account. You need programmatic access key to use it
   with buckup.

   * If you have `AWS CLI <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_ installed,
     you can save your credentials with
     `aws configure <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html>`_; or
   * you can set  ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
     environment variable containing your credentials.

   Read
   `boto3 documentation <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html>`_
   for more detail.

   1. If you want to restrict your access only to essential credentials to use
      buckup, please set them to:

      * ``iam:ListAccountAliases`` (not required to use)
      * ``s3:PutBucketPolicy``
      * ``s3:CreateBucket``
      * ``iam:GetUser``
      * ``iam:CreateUser``
      * ``s3:PutBucketCORS``
      * ``s3:PutBucketVersioning``
      * ``iam:CreateAccessKey``

2. After you set that up, you can type ``buckup`` and that should open the
   prompt.

   1. If you want to specify other than the default region, please use ``--region``
      flag with ``buckup``, e.g. ``buckup --region eu-west-2``.

3. After you answer all the questions you should obtain your bucket details
   that are ready to use in your application.
