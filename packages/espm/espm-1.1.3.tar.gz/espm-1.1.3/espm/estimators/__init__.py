r""" NMF Estimators.

The :mod:`espm.estimators` module implements different NMF algorithms.

The class :mod:`espm.estimators` is an abstract class for all NMF algorithms. It implements the fit and transform methods.
The fit method is implemented in the abstract class and calls the `_iteration` method which is implemented in the child classes. 
The transform method is implemented in the child classes.
