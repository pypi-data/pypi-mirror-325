Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! The development of
this package takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/adriente/espm>`_.
Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be reported `there
<https://github.com/adriente/espm/issues>`_.
Code and documentation can be improved by submitting a `pull request
<https://github.com/adriente/espm/pulls>`_. Please add documentation and
tests for any new code.

The package can be set up (ideally in a fresh virtual environment) for local
development with the following::

    $ git clone https://github.com/adriente/espm.git
    $ pip install -e .[dev]

You can improve or add functionality in the ``espm`` folder, along with
corresponding unit tests in ``espm/tests/test_*.py`` (with reasonable
coverage).
If you have a nice example to demonstrate the use of the introduced
functionality, please consider adding a notebook in ``doc/introduction/notebooks``.
In general, this can be done as a relative symbolic link to a notebook in the
``notebooks`` folder.

Update ``README.rst`` and ``CHANGELOG.rst`` if applicable.

After making any change, please run the tests, and build the
documentation with the following ::

    $ make test
    $ make doc

To iterate faster, you can partially run the test suite, at various degrees of
granularity, as follows::

   $ pytest espm.test.test_utils.py
   $ pytest espm.test.test_estimators.py

Making a release
----------------

#. Be sure that the test passes and that the documentation compiles.
#. Log to `readthedoc <https://readthedocs.org/projects/espm>`, 
   launch a build on latest and check that it can compile 
   the latest version of the documentation.
#. Update the version number and release date in ``setup.py``,
   ``espm/__init__.py`` and ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
#. Commit the changes with ``git commit -am "Bump to version 0.2.0"``.
#. Create a git tag with ``git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "espm v0.2.0"``.
#. Push the tag to GitHub with ``git push --tag``. The tag should now
   appear in the releases and tags tab.
#. `Create a release <https://github.com/adriente/esmpy/releases/new>`_ on
   GitHub and select the created tag. 
#. Build the distribution with ``make dist`` and check that the
   ``dist/espm-0.2.0.tar.gz`` source archive contains all required files. The
   binary wheel should be found as ``dist/espm-0.2.0.py3-none-any.whl``.
#. Test the upload and installation process::

    $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    $ pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple espm

#. Build and upload the distribution to the real PyPI with ``make release``.
