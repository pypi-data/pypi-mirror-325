espm: The Electron Spectro-Microscopy Python Library
=====================================================

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/espm/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://espm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest
    :alt: Documentation Status

The espm package is designed for simulation and physics-guided NMF decomposition of hyperspectral data.
Even though the package is mainly centered around electron spectro-microscopy applications, custom models can be implemented for other type of data.
Currently espm supports the simulation and analysis of simultaneous scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM / EDXS). 
In future implementation, we will try to extend the package to support electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).

This library is integrated as much as possible in the `hyperspy <https://hyperspy.org>` and `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>` frameworks.

The main components of the package are:
- The simulation of STEM-EDXS datasets using `espm.datasets` which combines `espm.weights` for the simulation of spatial distributions and `espm.models` for the simulation of spectra.
- The hyperspectral unmixing of STEM-EDXS spectrum images using `espm.estimators`. This module contains algorithms to perform non-negative matrix factorization with diverse regularisation (e.g. Laplacian or L1) and contraints (e.g. simplex).
- The `espm.models` module can also be used to perform a physics-guided decomposition of STEM-EDXS datasets.

Installation
------------

You can install this package from PyPi using::

    $ pip install espm

If you want to develop, please use the option::

    $ git clone https://github.com/adriente/espm.git
    $ cd espm
    $ pip install cython
    $ pip install -e .[dev] 

If you get issues regarding pandoc when using `make doc`, you can install it using::

    $ sudo apt-get install pandoc

or::
    
    $ conda install pandoc

Recommended Installation
------------------------

We recommend to install the package in a virtual environment using conda::

    $ conda create -n espm python=3.11
    $ conda activate espm
    $ pip install espm
    $ conda install jupyterlab

It is especially useful for the interactive plotting in the notebooks.
