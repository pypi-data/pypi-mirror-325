Welcome to the codebase of CRISPRzip from the [Depken Lab](https://depkenlab.tudelft.nl/) at TU
Delft.

## About the project
![Activity prediction with CRISPRzip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hiddeoff/crisprzip/main/img/activity_prediction.png)

CRISPRzip is a physics-based model to study the target 
recognition dynamics of CRISPR-associated nucleases like Cas9
[\[1\]](#references). Their interactions with target DNA is represented 
as an energy landscape, with which you can simulate binding and cleavage
kinetics. The parameters have been obtained by machine learning on 
high-throughput data (see [\[1\]](#references)).  CRISPRzip makes 
quantitative predictions of on-target efficiency and off-target risks of 
different guide RNAs.

With CRISPRzip, we hope to contribute to assessing
the risks that come with particular choices in CRISPR application, and as such
contribute to the development of safe gene editing technology.

## Installation
CRISPRzip is on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) and can be installed 
with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```shell
pip install crisprzip
```

## Usage
CRISPRzip makes predictions about cleavage and binding activity on on- and
off-targets. First, you define the protospacer and target sequence, and then,
you can predict the fraction cleaved or bound.
```python
# 1. load parameter set
import json
with open('data/landscapes/sequence_params.json', 'r') as file:
    sequence_params = json.load(file)['param_values']

# 2. define Cas9, gRNA and DNA target
from crisprzip.kinetics import *
searchertargetcomplex = SearcherSequenceComplex(
    protospacer = "AGACGCATAAAGATGAGACGCTGG",
    target_seq  = "AGACCCATTAAGATGAGACGCGGG",  # A13T G17C
    **sequence_params
)

# 3. predict activity
f_clv = searchertargetcomplex.get_cleaved_fraction(
    time=600, # 10 minutes
    on_rate=1E-1
)
f_bnd = searchertargetcomplex.get_bound_fraction(
    time=600, # 10 minutes
    on_rate=1E-1
)

# 4. format output
print(f"After 10 minutes, the target (A13T G17C) is ...")
print(f"- cleaved for {100*f_clv:.1f}% by Cas9")
print(f"    or  ")
print(f"- bound for {100*f_bnd:.1f}% by dCas9")
```
Output:
```
After 10 minutes, the target (A13T G17C) is ...
- cleaved for 10.5% by Cas9
    or  
- bound for 94.2% by dCas9
```

sequence, time and concentration dependency.
