## üìö Overview

**Electric Circuit Simulator** is a powerful Python package for simulating **electrical circuits** and **generators**. It supports both **sinusoidal** and **square wave generators**, as well as **RL circuit simulations**. The core calculations are written in **C++** for optimal performance, and Python bindings are provided using `pybind11` for easy integration.

This tool allows you to simulate, analyze, and visualize the behavior of **resistive-inductive (RL) circuits** powered by different signal generators.



## üßÆ Mathematical Explanation

### Sinusoidal Generator

The voltage $V(t)$ generated by a sinusoidal generator is given by the equation:

$$
V(t) = A \sin(2 \pi f t + \phi)
$$

Where:
- $A$ is the **amplitude**
- $f$ is the **frequency**
- $\phi$ is the **phase**
- $t$ is **time**

### Square Wave Generator

The voltage $V(t)$ produced by a square wave generator is:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\bg_white\color{white}\bf{V(t)%20=%20\begin{cases}%20A%20&%20\text{if%20}\mod(t,%20T)%20<%20\frac{T}{2}%20\\%20-A%20&%20\text{otherwise}%20\end{cases}}" />
</p>

Where:
- $A$ is the **amplitude**
- $T$ is the **period** (with $ T = \frac{1}{f} $)
- $f$ is the **frequency**
- $t$ is **time**

### RL Circuit Simulation

The RL circuit's behavior is governed by the differential equation:

$$
V(t) = L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + R I(t)
$$

Where:
- $V(t)$ is the **voltage** from the generator
- $I(t)$ is the **current** flowing through the circuit
- $L$ is the **inductance**
- $R$ is the **resistance**

This equation is solved iteratively using the **Euler method** for simulation.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Example

Here‚Äôs how you can use the Electric Circuit Simulator to analyze an RL circuit with different generators.

#Example 1
```python

from circuit_simulator.core import CircuitRL, SquareWaveGenerator

# Create generator
square_gen = SquareWaveGenerator(frequency=0.5, amplitude=0.5)

# Create RL circuit
circuit = CircuitRL(resistance=1, inductance=5)

# Simulate Circuit
result = circuit.simulate(generator=square_gen, t_end=1, dt=0.1)

# Print result
print(result) # [(0.0, 0.5, 0.010000000000000002), (0.1, 0.5, 0.019800000000000005), (0.2, 0.5, 0.029404000000000007), ...]

```
#Example 2
```python


from circuit_simulator.analyze import CircuitRLAnalyzer
from circuit_simulator.core import CircuitRL, SinusoidalGenerator, SquareWaveGenerator

# Create generators
sin_gen = SinusoidalGenerator(frequency=0.25, amplitude=0.5)
square_gen = SquareWaveGenerator(frequency=0.2, amplitude=0.2)

# Create RL circuit
circuit = CircuitRL(resistance=0.5, inductance=15)

# Create analyzer
analyzer = CircuitRLAnalyzer(generators={"sin": sin_gen, "square": square_gen}, circuit=circuit)

# Analyze the circuit
analyzer.analyze(end_time=10.0, step=0.1)

# Plot the results
analyzer.plot_results()
```
