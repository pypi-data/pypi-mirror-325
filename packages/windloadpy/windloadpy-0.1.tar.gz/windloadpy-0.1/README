# Wind Load Analysis

This project provides a wind load analysis tool based on the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the National Structural Code of the Philippines (NSCP) standards.

## Features

- Calculate wind loads based on ASCE 7-16 and NSCP 2015.
- Support for different building types and geometries.
- User-friendly interface for inputting building parameters.
- Detailed output of wind load calculations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wind-load-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd wind-load-analysis
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
2. Enter the required building parameters as prompted.
3. View the detailed wind load analysis results.

## Building Parameters

- **Building Height**: The height of the building in meters.
- **Building Width**: The width of the building in meters.
- **Building Length**: The length of the building in meters.
- **Exposure Category**: The exposure category as defined by ASCE and NSCP.
- **Wind Speed**: The basic wind speed in meters per second.

## Output

The output will include detailed calculations of wind pressures and forces acting on the building, based on the input parameters and the selected standard (ASCE or NSCP).
