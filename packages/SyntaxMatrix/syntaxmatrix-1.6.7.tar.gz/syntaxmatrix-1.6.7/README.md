# SyntaxMatrix UI Framework
Description & Key Features
SyntaxMatrix UI is a Python-based UI framework designed for building fast, interactive web apps - particularly for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, question answering, and other AI workflows. With many features in the pipeline, this version of the framework has the following features implemented:
•	Customizable Navigation: Edit or add navbar items in a built-in admin panel.
•	Admin UI: Add, rename, or remove navbar items without coding.
•	Session-Based State: Maintain user input, chat history, or UI state across requests using Python code.
•	Widget System: Quickly add text inputs, buttons, and more to your pinned layout.
Goals & Philosophy
1.	Rapid Prototyping: Let AI/ML developers stand up a frontend in minutes for demoing or testing.
2.	No Frontend Framework Knowledge Required: Users need not know any web framework for their Python projects. SyntaxMatrix UI integrates a web front end seamlessly.
3.	Extensible: The framework is adaptable for RAG tasks, chatbot demos, or a variety of data-driven apps.
Comparison with Streamlit
•	Similar:
o	Single-file usage in your Python code.
o	Global “import syntaxmatrix as smx” for UI calls (e.g., smx.text_input, smx.button).
o	Admin Panel: Manage pages dynamically without touching code.
