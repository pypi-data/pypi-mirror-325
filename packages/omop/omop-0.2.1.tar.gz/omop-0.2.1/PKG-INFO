# OMOP: OMOP Common Data Model

OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) is a common data model (CDM) that standardizes the structure and content of disparate healthcare data for large-scale observational research.
This schema models the OMOP data model accurately allowing for validation of OMOP modeled data.

More about OMOP can be found at the [OHDSI website](https://ohdsi.org) and on the [OMOP GitHub](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel).
