# `pydykit` Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and users are dedicated to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We want to foster actions and interactions in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind. This refers to words, phrases, or expressions that have a sexual connotation or content, which are in the respective context inappropriate and/or unnecessary. Context is keyâ€”what might be acceptable in one setting (e.g., consensual adult conversations) could be deemed inappropriate or harmful in another.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.
