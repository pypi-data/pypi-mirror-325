## 🎮 Usage

### **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
You can tokenize Japanese text directly from the terminal:

```sh
kanasplit-cli "こんにちは世界"
```

Example Output:
```
Tokenized Text:
- こんにちは (Interjection)
- 世界 (Noun)

Fetching meanings from Jisho.org...
Word: こんにちは - Reading: こんにちは - Meanings: hello, good day
Word: 世界 - Reading: せかい - Meanings: world, society, universe
```

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
KanaSplit also includes a Tkinter-based GUI for users who prefer a graphical interface.

To launch the GUI, simply run:

```sh
python GUI.py
```

This will open a window where you can enter Japanese text, process it, and view tokenized results.
