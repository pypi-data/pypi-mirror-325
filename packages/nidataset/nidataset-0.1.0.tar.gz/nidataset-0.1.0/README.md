# NIfTI dataset management

This package provides a set of utilities for handling NIfTI datasets, including slice extraction, volume manipulation, and various utility functions to facilitate the processing of medical imaging data.

## Installation
Install the package running:
```bash
pip install nidataset
```

## Import
Import the package as:
```python
import nidataset as nid
```

## Package organization

### Slices
Handles operations related to slices.

- **extract_slices**: Extracts slices from a NIfTI file and saves them as images .tif, based on the selected view and named with the NIfTI filename with the progressive slice number.
- **extract_slices_from_dataset**: Extracts slices from all NIfTI files in a dataset folder and saves them as images .tif, based on the selected view and named with the NIfTI filename with the progressive slice number.
- **extract_annotations**: Extracts annotations from a NIfTI  annotation file and saves them as CSV, based on the selected view and named with the NIfTI filename with the progressive slice number.
- **extract_annotations_from_dataset**: Extracts annotations from all NIfTI annotation files in a dataset folder and saves them as CSV.

### Utility
Handles operations related to utility.

- **dataset_images_info**: Extracts metadata from all NIfTI files in a dataset and saves the results in a CSV file.
- **dataset_annotations_info**: Extracts 3D bounding boxes from all NIfTI annotation files in a dataset and saves the results in a CSV file.

### Volume
Handles operations related to volume.

- **swap_nifti_views**: Swaps anatomical views in a NIfTI image by swapping axes, applying a 90-degree rotation.
- **mip**: Generates a 3D Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) from a NIfTI file.
- **mip_from_dataset**: Generates 3D Maximum Intensity Projections (MIP) from all NIfTI files in a dataset folder, renamed with suffix 'mip' followed by the view.
- **extract_bounding_boxes**: Extracts 3D bounding boxes from a segmentation mask and saves the bounding box annotation as a NIfTI file.
- **extract_bounding_boxes_from_dataset**: Extracts 3D bounding boxes from all segmentation masks in a dataset folder and saves them as NIfTI files.
- **generate_brain_mask**: Generates a brain mask from a brain CTA scan in NIfTI format.
- **generate_brain_mask_from_dataset**: Generates brain masks for all brain CTA scans in a dataset folder and saves them as NIfTI files.
- **crop_and_pad**: Finds the minimum bounding box around a CTA scan, resizes it to a target shape, and preserves spatial orientation.
- **crop_and_pad_from_dataset**: Processes all CTA scans in a dataset folder, applies crop_and_pad, and saves results.
