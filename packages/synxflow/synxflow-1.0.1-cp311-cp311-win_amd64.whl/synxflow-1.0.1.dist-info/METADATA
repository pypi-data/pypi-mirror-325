# SynxFlow: Synergising High-Performance Hazard Simulation with Data Flow
[![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/04b306f03970eb31c48199863ad669aa/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/04b306f03970eb31c48199863ad669aa) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/synxflow)](https://pepy.tech/project/synxflow)
## What the software can do

This software can dynamically simulate flood inundation, landslides runout and debris flows using multiple CUDA-enabled GPUs. It also offers an user-friendly yet versatile Python interface that can be fully integrated into data science workflows, aiming to streamline and accelerate hazard risk assessment tasks.

## Using the model

For how to install and use the model, please visit [here](https://synxflow.readthedocs.io)

## Running the model on Google Colab

The tutorials can also run on Google Colab by using one of the following links

## Using LLMs to control SynxFlow

It is also possible to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate script to use SynxFlow and build complex workflows. 

Please see this [tutorial](https://synxflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials/LLM.html) to learn how to do this.


## Acknowledgment
SynxFlow represents our distinct vision for the next generation of tools in this field, aiming to address evolving challenges and user needs with cutting-edge technologies. Our goal is to offer powerful, yet user-friendly tools for research and industrial applications, ensuring broad accessibility and applicability. In this spirit, SynxFlow is committed to being an open-source, community-driven and inclusive project. SynxFlow inherits code from established open-source software such as HiPIMS-CUDA [1] and Pypims [2]. The development of SynxFlow has also benefited from the skills, knowledge, and experience gained by its authors while contributing as main developers to HiPIMS-CUDA and Pypims.

[1] HiPIMS stands for High-Performance Integrated hydrodynamic Modelling System. HiPIMS is an open source flood Modelling suite developed and maintained by Prof Qiuhua Liang and his team in Loughborough University. 

[2] Pypims is a further development of HiPIMS-CUDA to provide a Python interface.
