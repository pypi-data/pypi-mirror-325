# Agenty

A Pythonic framework for building AI agents and LLM pipelines, powered by [pydantic-ai](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai). The framework emphasizes simplicity and maintainability without sacrificing power, making it an ideal choice for rapid prototyping.

ðŸ“š **[Documentation](https://agenty.readthedocs.io/)**

> [!Caution]
> **Initial Development**: Agenty is under active development. Expect frequent breaking changes until we reach a stable release.

Agenty provides a clean, type-safe interface for creating:
- Conversational AI agents with structured inputs and outputs
- LLM pipelines
- Complex agent interactions with minimal boilerplate

## Key Features
- Intuitive Pythonic interfaces that feel natural to use
- Structured Agent I/O for predictable behavior
- Agent Pipelines to enable sequential workflows
- Jinja2 templates for prompts and messages for dynamic context
- Built on pydantic-ai for type validation
- Automatic conversation history management

The framework is currently only officially tested with the OpenAI API (through a proxy such as [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/simple_proxy)/[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quick-start)) although theoretically it supports all the models supported by pydantic-ai.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a more mature alternative? Check out [atomic-agents](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents), which heavily inspired this project.

## Installation

```bash
pip install agenty
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add agenty
```

## Quick Preview

Here's a simple example to get started:
```python
import asyncio
from agenty import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIModel(
            "gpt-4o",
            api_key="your-api-key"
        ),
        system_prompt="You are a helpful and friendly AI assistant."
    )

    response = await agent.run("Hello, how are you?")
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```
In most cases, to build a custom AI agent, you'll want to create your own class that inherits from `Agent.` The below is functionally equivalent to the above code (and is the recommended way to use this framework)
```python
import asyncio
from agenty import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

class Assistant(Agent):
    model = OpenAIModel("gpt-4o", api_key="your-api-key")
    system_prompt = "You are a helpful and friendly AI assistant."

async def main():
    agent = Assistant()
    response = await agent.run("Hello, how are you?")
    print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Simple Tools

Functions can be used as tools through a simple decorator pattern.

1. **Define Your Agent:** Create a custom class that inherits from the base Agent class.

2. **Implement Tool Methods**: Add methods to your agent class that will serve as tools. Each method should include a docstring that describes the tool. You can even add parameter descriptions in the docstring and pydantic-ai implements [griffe](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/griffe/) to automatically generate tool parameter descriptions.

3. **Register Tools:** Use the `@tool` decorator to mark methods as tools. The decorator automatically registers these methods, making them available for your agent to use during execution. No additional configuration is needed.

Here's an example of a roulette game agent:
```python
import asyncio
import random

from agenty import Agent, tool
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel


class RouletteAgent(Agent):
    model = OpenAIModel("gpt-4o", api_key="your-api-key")
    system_prompt = "You're a dice game, you should roll the die and see if the number matches the user's guess."

    def __init__(self, player_name: str, num_sides: int = 10, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.player_name = player_name
        self.num_sides = num_sides

    @tool
    def get_player_name(self) -> str:
        """Get the player's name."""
        return self.player_name

    @tool
    def roll_die(self) -> int:
        """Roll a n-sided die and return the result."""
        num = random.randint(1, self.num_sides)
        print(f"Rolled a {num}!")
        return num


async def main():
    agent = RouletteAgent(player_name="John", num_sides=6)
    response = await agent.run("I guess the number will be 3!")
    print(response)


asyncio.run(main())
```
