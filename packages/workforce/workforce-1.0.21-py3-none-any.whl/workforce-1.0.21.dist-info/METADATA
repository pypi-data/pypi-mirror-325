Build and run a pipeline of bash commands with python multiprocessing according to a tsv file edgelist.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://workforce.readthedocs.io.


Installation
------------
Installation can be done with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install workforce

Building a workforce workflow
-----------------------------
To launch the pipeline builder, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   workforce

To open a previously constructed pipeline, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   workforce <PIPELINE.tsv>

Running workforce
-----------------
To run a sample plan from workforce github project:

.. code-block:: bash

   workforce -r example_plan.tsv

To run individual process(es) from the builder, select the process(es) in the order that you wish them to be excecuted and click the 'Run' button. The command line from where the builder was launched will display the standard output and error for each process.

Deleting processes from the project can be done by selecting a process and clicking the 'Delete' button

The simplest way to edit a process is to click the edge that the process is connected to. This will fill the 'Input' box with the connection details. You can then add a new node with those connections and delete the old process.

To import and use in a python shell, use the following command:

.. code-block:: python

   from workforce.workforce import worker
   worker("<PLAN.CSV>")

The schema should be in the format of a tsv with two columns. On the left and right column is the source and target process respectively (see example).

This is tested on mac and linux but requires work for windows integration except for wsl2
