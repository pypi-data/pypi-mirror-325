Marvin
======

Marvin is the ultimate tool to visualise and analyse MaNGA data. It is
developed and maintained by the MaNGA team.

Installation
------------

To install Marvin:

::

    pip install sdss-marvin

If you would like to contribute to Marvin's development, you can clone
this git repo, and run pip install in editable mode which will install all the
dev dependencies:

::

    git clone https://github.com/sdss/marvin
    cd marvin
    pip install -e ".[dev,web,db]"

This will install all dependencies needed for development and testing, including for
the Marvin web/api server and the Marvin use of the MaNGA database.

Testing
-------

To run the test suite on Marvin, use ``pytest tests/``.  By default this will run all tests against
Marvin's core file access mode, as well as its database and remote access modes. The test suite uses
the following two galaxies: `8485-1901` and `7443-12701` for testing. To successfully run all tests
you will need:

*  The file data for the two test galaxies
*  A local MaNGA database with the galaxy loaded into it
*  A local Marvin web server running

You can download the necessary test data with the command.
::

   python bin/get_test_data.py

You can run a local Marvin web server with the following command.  This will start a local web server running
in debug mode on port 5000.
::

   cd bin/
   run_marvin -d -p 5000

You can disable database and web server tests by using Pytest markers.  The availble markers and options are:

*  **slow**: Run only slow tests.
*  **uses_db**: Run only tests that use the database.
*  **uses_web**: Run only tests that use the web/api server.
*  **--local-only**: Run only tests that use local data.

To run the test suite minimally against the core marvin package with local file access, use the following command:
::

   pytest --local-only -m "not uses_db and not uses_web and not slow" tests/


What is Marvin?
---------------

Marvin is a complete ecosystem designed for overcoming the challenge of
searching, accessing, and visualizing the MaNGA data. It consists of a
three-pronged approach of a web app, a python package, and an API. The
web app, Marvin-web, provides an easily accessible interface for
searching the MaNGA data and visual exploration of individual MaNGA
galaxies or of the entire sample. The python package, in particular
Marvin-tools, allows users to easily and efficiently interact with the
MaNGA data via local files, files retrieved from the `Science Archive
Server <https://sas.sdss.org>`__, or data directly grabbed from the
database. The tools come mainly in the form of convenience functions and
classes for interacting with the data. An additional tool is a powerful
query functionality that uses the API to query the MaNGA databases and
return the search results to your python session. Marvin-API is the
critical link that allows Marvin-tools and Marvin-web to interact with
the databases, which enables users to harness the statistical power of
the MaNGA data set.
