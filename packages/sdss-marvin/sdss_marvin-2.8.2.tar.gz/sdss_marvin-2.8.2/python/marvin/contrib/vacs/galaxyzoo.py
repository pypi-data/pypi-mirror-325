    VAC name: MaNGA Morphologies from Galaxy Zoo

    URL: https://www.sdss.org/dr17/data_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac_id=manga-morphologies-from-galaxy-zoo
    
    Description Returns Galaxy Zoo morphology for MaNGA galaxies. 
    The Galaxy Zoo (GZ) data for SDSS galaxies has been split over several iterations of www.galaxyzoo.org, 
    with the MaNGA target galaxies being spread over five different GZ data sets. In this value added catalog,
    for DR15, we bring all of these galaxies into one single catalog and re-run the debiasing code (Hart et al. 2016) in 
    a consistent manner across the all the galaxies. This catalog includes data from Galaxy Zoo 2 (previously 
    published in Willett et al. 2013) and newer data from Galaxy Zoo 4 (currently unpublished).

    For DR17, we provide new and updated Galaxy Zoo (GZ) data for the final MaNGA galaxies. This has been split over 
    three files, each corresponding to a separate GZ catalogue. We have `MaNGA_GZD_auto-v1_0_1.fits`, which
    corresponds to the automated classifications GZ DECaLS, described in Walmsley et al. 2021. There is also 
    `MaNGA_gzUKIDSS-v1_0_1.fits`, which correponds to GZ:UKIDSS. Finally, we have put the rest of GZ 
    (so not including GZ DECaLS and GZ:UKIDSS) in `MaNGA_gz-v2_0_1.fits`. For more information, please 
    refer to the datamodels provided.

    Authors: Coleman Krawczyk, Karen Masters, Tobias GÃ©ron and the rest of the Galaxy Zoo Team.
