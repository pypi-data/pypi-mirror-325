# InsightfulPy

**InsightfulPy** is a comprehensive Python package designed to simplify Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflows. It provides powerful utilities for analyzing both numerical and categorical data, detecting outliers, handling missing values, and generating insightful visualizations.

## Features

-  **Numerical Analysis**: Summarize numerical features with detailed statistics like mean, median, mode, skewness, kurtosis, and more.
-  **Categorical Analysis**: Generate frequency tables, detect high-cardinality features, and analyze mixed data types.
-  **Visualization Tools**: Create box plots, KDE plots, QQ plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts effortlessly.
-  **Outlier Detection**: Identify outliers using the IQR method and visualize them.
-  **Missing Data Handling**: Visualize missing data patterns using `missingno`.
-  **Customizable Summaries**: Grouped statistical summaries with `TableOne` for deeper insights.
