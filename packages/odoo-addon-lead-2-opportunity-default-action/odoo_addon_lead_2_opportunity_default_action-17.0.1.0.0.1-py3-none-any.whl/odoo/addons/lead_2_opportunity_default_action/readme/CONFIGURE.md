In order to set a default conversion action for the Lead to Opportunity wizard you need to create or edit the lead_2_opportunity_default_action.default system parameter. There are two accepted values:

- **convert**: for 'Convert to opportunity' action
- **merge**: for 'Merge with existing opportunities' action

If the system parameter is not defined or it does not contain any of those options, the default value will be applied.
