# JS_Moraware
 Interaction with Moraware using Python

Intended to be the FINAL PUBLIC published repo for JS-related libraries.
Will include JS_Moraware and optionally other JS code (unless they're published separately).

Version no# matches my private library and is an exact clone (copy-paste) besides anonymised.
