title: PCI Host Bridge Nodes

description: |
  Common properties for PCI host bridge nodes. PCI host bridges implement the
  PCI bus binding plus additional properties for mapping host resources into
  PCI space.

    description:
      If present this property assigns a fixed PCI domain number to a host bridge,
      otherwise an unstable (across boots) unique number will be assigned.
      It is required to either not set this property at all or set it for all
      host bridges in the system, otherwise potentially conflicting domain numbers
      may be assigned to root buses behind different host bridges.  The domain
      number for each host bridge in the system must be unique.
