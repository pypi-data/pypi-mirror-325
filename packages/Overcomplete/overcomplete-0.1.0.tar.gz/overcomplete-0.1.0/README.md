Overcomplete is a compact research library in Pytorch designed to study (Overcomplete)-Dictionary learning methods to extract concepts from large Vision models. In addition, this repository also introduces various visualization methods, attribution and metrics. However, Overcomplete emphasizes **experimentation**.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Overcomplete

Overcomplete requires Python 3.8 or newer and several dependencies, including Numpy. It supports both only Torch. Installation is straightforward with Pypi:

```bash
pip install overcomplete
```

With Overcomplete installed, you can dive into any optimisation based dictionary learning method to extract visual features. The API is designed to be intuitive, requiring only a few hyperparameters to get started.

Example usage:

```python
import torch
import overcomplete
todo
```
