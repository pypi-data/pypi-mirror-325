              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# UnitcellEngine

> [!WARNING]
> This is alpha software that is in active development and is likely to experience breaking changes.

*UnitcellEngine* is part of the *UnitcellHub* software ecosystem, providing functionality to generate and simulate lattice unitcell geometries.
Written fully in Python, it brings together state-of-the-art technology like implicit geometry representation, meshless finite element analysis, and homogenization theory, to provide an automated yet robust pipeline.

![](docs/source/images/overview.png)
 
## Installation

UnitcellEngine only supports Python 3. 
If running on a Windows machine, you may sometimes need to first install Microsoft Visual C++ for some of the dependencies to install correctly (such as number and scikit-learn). See https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ for details on how to install the Windows C++ Build Tools; 
additionally, due to performance limitations of the openblas-based installation of numpy via pip, it is recommended that conda be used to setup the base numpy/scipy environment.

For the current stable release

```
pip install unitcellengine

```

## Examples

*UnitcellEngine* has a range of built-in lattice geometry forms, including graph-style (such as beam and plate) and thin walled Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) lattices.
The general workflow is to define the unitcell, generate the geometry, generate the mesh, and solve the relevant homogenization problems.
Each step of the process calculates relevant quantities and stores them in output files that feed into subsequent calculations (for example, a mesh file is required before a homogenization can be run).

```python
from unitcellengine.design import UnitcellDesign, UnitcellDesigns
import numpy as np

# Set numpy precision to allow for better printout of homogenized matrices
np.set_printoptions(precision=4)

# Define unitcell
design = UnitcellDesign('Octet', 1, 1, 1, thickness=0.1)

# The default behavior is to reuse existing date. Set to False to force regeneration.
reuse = True

# Generate geometry (which calculated propertes like relative denstiy and relative surface area)
design.generateGeometry(reuse=reuse)

# Generate mesh
design.generateMesh(reuse=reuse)

# Calculate homogenized elastic properties
design.homogenizationElastic.run(reuse)

# Post process homogenization results
design.homogenizationElastic.process()

# Calculate homogenized conductance properties
design.homogenizationConductance.run(reuse)

# Post process conductance results
design.homogenizationConductance.process()

# Print the homogenizated stiffness matrix
print(design.homogenizationElastic)
print(design.homogenizationConductance)
```
The results are by default stored in the folder structure "Database/<unitcell form>/<unitcell type>/<LX_XXX_WY_YYY_HZ_ZZZ_TU_UUU>", where <unitcell form> is either "graph" or "walledtpms", "unicell type" is the unitcell type, and "<LX_XXX_WY_YYY_HZ_ZZZ_TU_UUU>" is a folder with the Length, Width, Height, and Thickness properties of the lattice.
For example, in the case above, it will store the results in "Database/graph/Octet/L1_000_W1_000_H1_000_T0_100".

For more usage examples, see [examples/examples.ipynb](examples/examples.ipynb).

## High Performance Computing and remote Linux servers
When running on remote systems, there are a few features that don't work straight out of the box. 
If geometry rendering is required (which relies on VTK), additional utitilies will likely need to be installed.

### CENTOS and RH systems without root privileges
Xvfb is an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware and no physical input devices. 
It emulates a dumb frame buffer using virtual memory. 
Install xvfb following the steps defined here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36651091/how-to-install-packages-in-linux-centos-without-root-user-with-automatic-depen. 
Note, on most HPC systems, these files should be installed on a high performance file system rather than a network drive. 

In addition to xvfb, you will need to install the OpenGL libraries "mesa-libGL" and "mesa-libGL-devel" using the same steps as for xvfb. 
In some cases, you might still get an "GLSL 1.50 is not supported. 
Supported versions are: 1.10, 1.20, 1.30, 1.00 ES, and 3.00 ES" error. 
In this case, add the following environmental variable

```
export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.2
```
