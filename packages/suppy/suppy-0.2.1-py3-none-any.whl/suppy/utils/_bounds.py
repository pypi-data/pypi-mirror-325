    A class to help with hyperslab calculations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lb : None or array_like, optional
        Lower bounds. If None, defaults to negative infinity if `ub` is provided.
    ub : None or array_like, optional
        Upper bounds. If None, defaults to positive infinity if `lb` is provided.

    Attributes
    ----------
    l : array_like
        Lower bounds.
    u : array_like
        Upper bounds.
    half_distance : array_like
        Half the distance between lower and upper bounds.
    center : array_like
        Center point between lower and upper bounds.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the sizes of the lower and upper bounds do not match.
        If any lower bound is greater than the corresponding upper bound.
