# SupPy - Python superiorization library

`SupPy` is a native python library for user-friendly setup and evaluation of superiorzation algorithms.

## General introduction
The Superiorization Method(SM) uses feasibility-seeking algorithms, i.e., algorithms that aim at finding apoint in the intersection of a finite number of given closed convex sets, i.e.,(
$
\text{find } \mathbf{x}\in C = \bigcap_i C_i
$).


In the SM the feasibility-seeking algorithm must be "perturbation resilient" in the sense that convergence of the feasibility-seeking iterative process is retained even when such perturbations are inserted into this iterative process. Given is also a real-valued objective function $\phi$. In contrast to constrained optimization of this objective function over the feasible set C, the goal of the SM is not to find a constrained minimum point but rather to reach a feasible point with reduced (not necessarily minimal) objective function value compared with the objective function value of a feasible point that would have been reached by the feasibility-seeking only algorithm.

 Further information and references on the SM can be found in papers listed in the bibliographic collection on the [dedicated Webpage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04219). For recent works that include introductory material on the SM see, e.g., [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11590-022-01961-y), [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36541524/), [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14724). A recent work on applying the SM to problems in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning appears [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1238824).

## Installation
Install simply via pip:

```
pip install suppy
```

In general SupPy works on the CPU (`numpy`), as well as the GPU(`cupy`). The standard installation will not set up `cupy`.
For installation check your CUDA version and the [cupy installation guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html).

## Usage

`SupPy` is a modular library for building and running superiorization models.
it allows for quick setup of feasibility seeking and superiorization algorithms.

Projections for simple structures like halfspaces or circles have dedicated implementations in the `suppy.projections` submodule and allow for visualization of the structure if they are 2D objects.

```
import numpy as np
from suppy.projections import HalfspaceProjection
a = np.array([1.,1.])
b = 3
halfspace = HalfspaceProjection(a,b)
halfspace.visualize()
```

To calculate the projection each ``Projection`` object has a dedicated function (which if possible changes the array in place):
```
x = np.array([4.,4.])
x_p = halfspace.project(x)
```

### Combined projections
For more complex structures that are formulated as the intersection of multiple constraints implementations for standard methods (``SequentialProjection``,``SimultaneousProjection``) and combinations of the two (``StringAveragedProjection``,``BlockIterativeProjection``) are available.

```
import numpy as np
from suppy.projections import BallProjection,SequentialProjection
center_1 = np.array([1,1])
radius_1 = 2
center_2 = np.array([-0.5,-1])
radius_2 = 1
ball_1 = BallProjection(center_1,radius_1)
ball_2 = BallProjection(center_2,radius_2)
joined_projection = SequentialProjection([ball_1,ball_2])
```
For a single projection step of these methods the ``project`` function can be used again. However since one step often times is not enough to find a point in the intersection, an entire run is needed.
This can be done by calling the ``solve`` method.

```
joined_projection.solve(np.array([3,3]))
```

### Linear algorithms

For linear problems $Ax\leq b$ dedicated implementations are available (right now formulated as $lb \leq Ax \leq ub$). In general ``AMS``, ``ARM``(Automatic relaxation method) and a sequential ``ART3+`` implementation are available.

```
import numpy as np
from suppy.feasibility import SequentialAMSHyperslab
A = np.array([[1,1],[1,0]])
lb = np.array([-2,-2])
ub = np.array([2,2])
alg = SequentialAMSHyperslab(A,lb,ub)
alg.solve(np.array([5.,5.]),max_iter = 100)
```

In general these algorithms have the same functions as the basic projections (``solve()``,``project()``,etc.) and can be used as part of joined projections.

## Superiorization

For setting up superiorzation models a feasibility seeking algorithm as well as a perturbation scheme are required.
For gradient step based perturbations this can be set up in the following way:
```
from suppy.perturbations import PowerSeriesGradientPerturbation

def objective(x):
    return 1/len(x)*(x**2).sum(axis = 0)

def gradient(x):
    grad = 1/len(x)*2*x
    return grad/np.sqrt(np.sum(grad**2))

pert = PowerSeriesGradientPerturbation(objective,gradient)

from suppy.superiorization import Superiorization

sup_model = Superiorization(alg,pert)
sup_model.solve(np.array([3,2]), 1000)
```
