Build123d is a python-based, parametric, [boundary representation (BREP)][BREP] modeling framework for 2D and 3D CAD. It's built on the [Open Cascade] geometric kernel and allows for the creation of complex models using a simple and intuitive python syntax. Build123d can be used to create models for 3D printing, CNC machining, laser cutting, and other manufacturing processes.  Models can be exported to a wide variety of popular CAD tools such as [FreeCAD] and SolidWorks.

Build123d could be considered as an evolution of [CadQuery] where the somewhat restrictive Fluent API (method chaining) is replaced with stateful context managers - e.g. `with` blocks - thus enabling the full python toolbox: for loops, references to objects, object sorting and filtering, etc.

The documentation for **build123d** can be found at [readthedocs](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

There is a [***Discord***](https://discord.com/invite/Bj9AQPsCfx) server (shared with [CadQuery]) where you can ask for help in the build123d channel.

The recommended method for most users to install **build123d** is:

```
pip install build123d
```

To get the latest non-released version of **build123d** one can install from GitHub using one of the following two commands:

Linux/MacOS:

```
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/gumyr/build123d
```

Windows:

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/gumyr/build123d
```

If you receive errors about conflicting dependencies, you can retry the installation after having upgraded pip to the latest version with the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Development install:

```
git clone https://github.com/gumyr/build123d.git
cd build123d
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Further installation instructions are available (e.g. Poetry) see the [installation section on readthedocs](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
