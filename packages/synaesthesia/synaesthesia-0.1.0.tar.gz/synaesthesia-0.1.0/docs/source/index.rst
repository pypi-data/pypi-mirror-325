Welcome to Synaeshesia's documentation!
===================================

*Create general PyTorch data pipelines from simple Python, extendable to any sensors.*

**Synaeshesia** Synaesthesia is a Python library that forms the foundation of a dataset stack in any PyTorch/PyTorch Lightning projects.
It contains base datasets and structures that enable combination, sequencing, concatenation, and other transformations through composition mechanisms.

This library provides a flexible and modular approach to creating datasets and dataloaders for various applications.
It's designed to handle different data types, including CSV and image datasets, with the ability to expand functionality through custom classes.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
