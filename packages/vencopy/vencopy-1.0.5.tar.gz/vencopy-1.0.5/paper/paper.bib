@article{Wilkinson.2016,
 abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

@misc{Gro.2023,
 abstract = {The decarbonization of energy systems worldwide requires a transformation of their design and operation across all sectors, that is, the residential and commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. Energy system models are frequently employed for assessing these changes, providing scenarios on potential future system design and on how new technologies and a modified infrastructure will meet future energy demands. Thus, they support investment decisions and policy-making. The Python-based Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment (ETHOS.FINE) is a software package that provides a toolbox for modeling, analyting and evaluating such energy systems using mathematical optimization. ETHOS.FINE is part of the Energy Transformation paTHway Optimization Suite (ETHOS) , a collection of modeling tools developed by the Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-Economic System Analysis (IEK-3) at Forschungszentrum J{\"u}lich. ETHOS offers a holistic view on energy systems at arbitrary scales providing tools for geospatial renewable potential analyses, time series simulation tools for residential and industrial sector, discrete choice models for the transportation sector, modeling of global energy supply routes, and local infrastructure assessments, among others. The ETHOS model suite is, e.g., used for analyzing the energy transition of Germany (Stolten et al., 2022).},

@article{GaeteMorales.2021,
 abstract = {There is substantial research interest in how future fleets of battery-electric vehicles will interact with the power sector. Various types of energy models~are used for respective analyses. They depend on meaningful input parameters, in particular time series of vehicle mobility, driving electricity consumption, grid availability, or grid electricity demand. As the availability of such data is highly limited, we introduce the open-source tool emobpy. Based on mobility statistics, physical properties of battery-electric vehicles, and other customizable assumptions, it derives time series data that can readily be used in a wide range of model applications. For an illustration, we create and characterize 200 vehicle profiles for Germany. Depending on the hour of the day, a fleet of one million vehicles has a median grid availability between 5 and 7 gigawatts, as vehicles are parking most of the time. Four exemplary grid electricity demand time series illustrate the smoothing effect of balanced charging strategies.},
