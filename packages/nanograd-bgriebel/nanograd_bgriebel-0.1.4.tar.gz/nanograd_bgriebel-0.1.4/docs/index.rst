Nanograd documentation
======================

Nanograd-bgriebel is a scalar automatic differentiation engine, with a neural
network api similar to PyTorch. It uses reverse mode automatic differentiation 
to calculate gradients, allowing for gradient descent based training of neural 
networks. Nanograd-bgriebel is based on Andrej Karpathy's `micrograd`_.
