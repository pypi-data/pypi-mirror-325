## HL Gauss - Pytorch

The proposed Gaussian Histogram Loss (HL-Gauss) proposed by Imani et al. with a few convenient wrappers, in Pytorch.

A team at Deepmind wrote a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03950) with a lot of positive findings for its use in value-based RL.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install hl-gauss-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from hl_gauss_pytorch import HLGaussLoss

hl_gauss = HLGaussLoss(0., 5., 32, sigma = 0.5)

logits = torch.randn(1, 16, 32).requires_grad_()
targets = torch.randint(0, 5, (1, 16)).float()

loss = hl_gauss(logits, targets)
loss.backward()
```
