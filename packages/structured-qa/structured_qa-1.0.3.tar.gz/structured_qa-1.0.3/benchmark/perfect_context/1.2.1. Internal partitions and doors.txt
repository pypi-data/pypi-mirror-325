Fire resistance of partitions:
- Copy rooms must have vertical partitions with a fire resistance of EI 30 and doors must have
a fire resistance of EI1 30 and close automatically (linked to the fire detection system).
Door retaining devices:
- Certain fire doors for rooms which are accessed or traversed very frequently are kept open
using magnetic retainers linked to the fire detection system (e.g. entrance halls and lift
lobbies, corridor compartment doors, kitchenette doors and doors of copy rooms).
- As a minimum, rooms accommodating kitchenettes must have doors which close
automatically (linked to the fire detection system).
Door closers:
- In addition to the requirements set out in the applicable legislation, access doors to
toilets/washrooms, kitchenettes, copy rooms, etc. must also be fitted with door closers.
Horizontal communication between two buildings:
- In the case of doors forming an airlock between two buildings, an intermittent red light
signal should be placed above or beside the door frames. This signal should light up on the
non-dangerous side to indicate the danger when the alarm is raised.
