Data on diversity trends about European CS graduates
comes from Informatics Europe. 3
Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Bachelor’s
Graduates
In the majority of surveyed European nations, there
is a persistent gender disparity among bachelor’s-
level graduates in informatics, computer science,
computer engineering, and information technology.
Despite some narrowing since 2011, men continue to
dominate. For example, France (14.8%), the United
Kingdom (17.8%), and Germany (21.5%) show relatively
low proportions of female graduates in these fields
(Figure 8.1.15). Bulgaria stands out among the surveyed
countries with the highest proportion of female
graduates (35.2%).
Informatics, CS, CE, and IT Master’s Graduates
Similar gender disparities are observed among
European informatics, CS, CE, and IT master’s
graduates, with a significantly greater proportion of
males than females in most surveyed countries. As of
2022, Estonia (42.0%), Romania (41.9%), and Bulgaria
(40.4%) reported the greatest proportion of female
master’s graduates (Figure 8.1.16). In contrast, Belgium
(13.7%), Italy (14.1%), and Switzerland (15.8%) reported
the smallest proportion of female master’s graduates.
Informatics, CS, CE, and IT PhD Graduates
In all surveyed European countries, informatics,
CS, CE, and IT PhD graduates are predominantly
male. However, in nations such as the United
Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland, the gender
gap has narrowed over the last decade, with women
constituting a growing share of PhD graduates (Figure
8.1.17).4 In contrast, countries like Finland and Spain
have seen the gap slightly widen.
