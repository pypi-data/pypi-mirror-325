This is the main phase of the game in which players take
their actions to build Locations, use their Clan action
pawn to activate Action tiles, and use actions of different
Locations.
Starting with the First player and continuing clockwise,
each player performs one action at a time. Each player can
take any available action or pass.
AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
> Build a Location
> Use a Clan action pawn
> Raid an opponent
> Use an action from a Location

All actions are described in detail in a separate chapter
(see pages 9-11).
> Once a player passes in the Action phase they cannot
perform any additional actions in the current round.
Neither can they be targeted by the actions of other
players. For example, a player who has passed cannot
have any of his Locations Raided.
> There is no limit to the number, type, or order of
actions a player may take during the Action phase, so
long as they perform them one action at a time.
> The Action phase continues until all players have
passed. If any player has reached or passed the 25
during this phase, the last round is triggered and the
game will end upon the completion of the Expedition
phase of this round.
