There are three immediate victory conditions:
Quest of the Ring
For the Fellowship: If Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, they destroy the One Ring and you immediately
win the game.
For Sauron: If the Nazg√ªl catch Frodo and Sam, they seize the One Ring and you immediately win the game.
Support of the Races
If you gather 6 different Race symbols on your Green cards, you rally the support of the Races
of Middle-earth and immediately win the game.
Note: The Eagle symbol, present on one Alliance token, is an additional Race symbol that counts as 1 of the 6 required
symbols for the Support of the Races victory.
Conquering Middle-earth
If you are present in all 7 regions (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit), you dominate Middle-earth
and immediately win the game.
If none of these three victory conditions are achieved by the end of chapter 3, the player who is present in the most
regions of Middle-earth (with a Fortress and/or at least 1 Unit) wins the game. In case of tie, share the victory.
