IN ADDITION TO DECIDING HOW “OPEN” YOU
want to make your work, you will also need to decide
where you will make your work openly accessible. This
involves first deciding which open access model (or
models) you will use to disseminate your work. Then,
you need to decide what publication venue (or venues)
within that model best suits your needs.
Open access models are generally divided into two
categories: “Gold Open Access” and “Green Open Access.”
Gold Open Access describes the model by which an open
access publisher makes your work openly accessible. If
you opt to use the Gold Open Access model, you will then
need to decide what open access publisher provides the
best venue for your work. In contrast, Green Open Access
(also called “self-archiving”) describes the model by
which you as an author make your work openly

accessible. If you opt to use the Green Open Access
model, you will then need to select the best online
venue for your work. Some options include your own
website, your departmental website, or an open access
repository.
Gold and Green Open Access are not mutually
exclusive. An author can publish a work with an open
access publisher and upload the same work to an
open access repository or personal website, and vice
versa (depending on the terms of their publishing
agreement).
