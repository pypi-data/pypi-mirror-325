NOTE: Skip the Cleanup phase in the final round.
In this phase:
> Players take all Workers from their Clan tile back to their
supply.
> Players unexhaust all cards (rotate them to their initial position)
in front of them.
> Players take back their Clan action pawns from Action tiles.
> Discard any remaining, face-up Island cards and reveal new ones.
> Pass the First player marker to the next player in clockwise order.
> If no one has reached or passed the 25 on the scoreboard
during the Action phase, begin a new round. If anyone reached
25 or more during the Expedition phase, the next round will
be the last one.
IMPORTANT: Goods are never discarded at the end of the round
