Natural light is required for all permanent work stations and for restaurants.
As a general rule, preference should be given to the use of natural lighting; at least 80% of the
surface area of offices should have a daylight factor (according to the International Commission
on Illumination (CIE)) of 1.5% for façades without exterior obstructions, and 0.7% for other
façades16.
See Section I.2.4. Electricity and lighting, paragraph 1 on the conditions which apply to
artificial lighting.
