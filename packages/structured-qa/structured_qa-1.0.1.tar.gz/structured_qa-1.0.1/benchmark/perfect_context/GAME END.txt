The game continues until a player reaches or passes the 25 space
on the scoreboard during the Action phase. Once that happens,
the final round is triggered and the game will end at the end of the
current round.
To calculate the final score, each player should:
> add 1 Victory Point for each card within their Empire to their
current score (including Basic Fields, Field upgrades, and
Conquered Islands),
> add 1 Victory Point for every 2 Resources remaining in their
supply (Resources assigned to cards are not counted towards
this scoring).
> add 1 Victory Point for every 1 Gold remaining in their supply
(Gold tokens assigned to cards are not counted).
The player with the most Victory Points is the winner.
TIES
In case of a tie, the player with the most Locations in their Empire
wins. If the players are still tied, the winner is the player with the
most Workers. If still tied, the winner is the player with the most
cards left in their hand. If there is still a tie, the tied players share
the victory!
