In this phase each player may decide to acquire up to 4 new cards
and add them to their hand.
To execute the Lookout phase follow these steps:
1. Each player should set aside any cards in their hand for the
time being.
2. Each player draws 4 cards from the top of their Clan deck and
decides which of these cards to keep.
3. For each card that they wish to keep, they have to Spend 1 of
their by putting it on their Clan tile.
4. Any cards they do not want to keep should be placed in the
Clan’s discard pile.
5. Players retrieve the cards they had set aside.

Example:
2 cards
placed
in the
discard
pile
2 Workers spent to keep 2 cards

IMPORTANT: Some cards have a Storage effect that may provide
players with extra Goods if enough of the required Resources are
assigned to them. A player gains those Goods at the end of each
Lookout phase, before starting the Action phase (more about this
effect on page 12).
NOTE 1: There’s no limit to the number of cards a player may have
in their hand.
NOTE 2: If there are no cards left in your Clan deck, shuffle the
discard pile to create a new deck.
> Cards in a player’s hand are kept secret from other players

No production phase!
A reminder, especially to all the fans of Imperial Settlers,
there is no production phase; players will have to use
Harvest action to gain Goods shown on the Field cards.
