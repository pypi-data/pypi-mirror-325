When you place or move one or more Units, two situations are possible:
If no enemy Unit is present: nothing happens.
If one or more enemy Units are present: trigger a conflict. Each player removes one of their Units
and places it back in front of them. Repeat this until at least one player has no more Units in the region.
Note: An enemy Fortress does not trigger conflicts and does not prevent you from placing your Units in its region.
Therefore, it is possible for both players to be present in the same region.

When you complete multiple movements, you may move the same Unit multiple times, or split your movement
between multiple Units. For each movement, move a Unit to an adjacent region (one with a connection).
You must complete each movement independently, resolving any conflict triggered, one at a time.

Example: You play a Purple card that provides 3 movements 1 . The first lets you move a Unit from Enedwaith to Rohan 2 .
Since there is an enemy Unit present, you trigger a conflict and each player removes their Unit. You then use
your second and third movements to send another Unit from Enedwaith to Mordor, passing through Rohan 3
