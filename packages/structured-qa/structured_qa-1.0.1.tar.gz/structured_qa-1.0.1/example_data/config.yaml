  You are given two pieces of information:

  2. A user question.

  Your task is to:
  - Identify exactly one `section_name` from the provided list that seems related to the user question.
  - Return the `section_name` exactly as it appears in the list.
  - Do NOT answer the question.
  - Do NOT return any additional text, explanation, or formatting.
  - Do NOT combine multiple section names into a single response.
