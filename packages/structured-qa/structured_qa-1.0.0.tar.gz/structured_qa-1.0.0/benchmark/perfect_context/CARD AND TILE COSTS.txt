Coins
In order to play them, certain cards have a Coin cost that you must pay to the reserve.

Skills
In order to play them, tiles and the majority of cards require you to have one
or more Skills (see page 5) in your play area.
If you do not have the required Skills, you may pay 1 Coin to the reserve
per missing Skill symbol.

Notes:
• There is no limit to the number of Skills you may pay for, to the reserve, on your turn.
• If a card does not require a Skill or a Coin, it has no cost, so you may play it for free.

Landmark tiles have an additional Coin cost equal to the number
of your Fortress pawns already on the central board.
Therefore, the additional cost of your first tile is 0 Coins.

Chaining
Starting in chapter 2, certain cards may be played for free through their chaining symbol.
If you have, in your play area, a card with a matching symbol in its top-right corner, you may play the card for free,
without having the required Skills.
Note: If you do not have the matching chaining symbol for a card, you may still play it normally by paying its Skill
and/or Coin cost.

Example:
In chapter 1, you play
this card for free 1 .
In addition to its effect
(see page 5), it has a chaining
symbol 2 .

n chapter 2, you may play this
card for free since you have
the matching chaining symbol 3
on one of your played cards.
Otherwise, you would need
to have the required Skills
(or pay 1 Coin per missing Skill
symbol) 4 .
