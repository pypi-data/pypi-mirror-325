Preparing a chapter
At the start of each chapter (1, 2, then 3), place cards from the corresponding chapter in the central play area,
following the diagram below (reminder on the sides of the box). Be careful, since certain cards are placed faceup
and others facedown. Place the 3 remaining cards, facedown, in the discard.

Turn overview
The Sauron player begins the game, then both players take turns, until the end of the game.
On your turn, you may either take a Chapter card or take a Landmark tile.

A. Take a Chapter card
From the central play area, choose an available card,
meaning one that is not partially covered by any other cards.
Then, play it in front of you or discard it.

Play the card in front of you
Pay the card cost, if any (see page 4), and place it
in your play area. You may immediately benefit
from its effect (see page 5).
Note: Stack cards in front of you by color, making sure
you can still see their effects.
Discard the card
Place the card, facedown, in the discard
and take as many Coins from the reserve
as the current chapter:
Chapter 1: 1 Coin
Chapter 2: 2 Coins
Chapter 3: 3 Coins

Finally, end your turn by revealing any cards that are now available.

B. Take a Landmark tile
Choose one of the faceup tiles. Pay its cost (see page 4) and place it in your play area.
Immediately place a Fortress pawn on the corresponding region of the central board and benefit
from its other effects (see the Player Aid).
Finally, end your turn without revealing a new tile.

End of a chapter
A chapter ends once the final card of this chapter has been taken.
Set up the cards for the next chapter according to the corresponding diagram and reveal new Landmark tiles
until there are, if possible, 3 faceup.
Then continue the game as normal.
Note: Since you alternate taking turns, the player who ends a chapter does not begin the next one, unless they are using
a “Take another turn” effect (see the Player Aid).
