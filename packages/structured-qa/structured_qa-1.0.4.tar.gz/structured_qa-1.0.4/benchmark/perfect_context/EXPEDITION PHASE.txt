One after another, starting from the first Ship token placed on the arrow,
players choose a single Island to either Pillage or Conquer for each one of
their Ships.
A player with just a Ship on the Expedition board (no Raze token or Fish
assigned) can choose any face-up Nearby Island, or draw from the top of the
Nearby Island deck. To be able to take any Distant Island card, either face-
up or from the top of the deck, the Ship performing that expedition must have
had a fish assigned to it. Rations are needed for the long journey!
A player can choose to Pillage a selected Island card without any additional
cost to gain the Goods presented on the Pillage space. They then put the
Pillaged card on the appropriate discard pile (for Nearby and Distant Islands).
If a player has assigned a Ship with a Raze token, they can choose to Conquer
an Island and add it to their Empire to gain access to its action and/or ability.
Each Conquered Island also provides 1 VP at the end of the game, just like any
other Location.
Once a player has chosen an Island card to either Pillage or Conquer, they
return the used Ship to their supply and discard any Raze token and/or Fish
assigned to that Ship, even if they didnâ€™t use them. Now, if there is another
Ship in the queue, it is their turn to choose an Island card.
NOTE 1: Some cards Feature effects are triggered when a card is Conquered.
This happens when you move the Island card to your Empire, not when you
assign a Ship during a Sail action (see page 10).
NOTE 2: If there are no cards left in the Island deck, shuffle the discarded
cards to make up the new deck.
