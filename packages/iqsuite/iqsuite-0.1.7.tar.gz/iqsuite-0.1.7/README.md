### Step 2: Initialize the Client

With your API key in hand, you can now initialize the iQ Suite client in your Python application.

#### Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

Storing your API key in an environment variable enhances security by keeping sensitive information out of your codebase.

1. **Set the Environment Variable:**

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     set IQSUITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     export IQSUITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

2. **Initialize the Client in Python:**

   ```python
   import os
   from iqsuite import IQSuiteClient
   from iqsuite.exceptions import APIError, AuthenticationError

   # Retrieve the API key from environment variables
   api_key = os.getenv("IQSUITE_API_KEY")

   # Initialize the iQ Suite client
   client = IQSuiteClient(api_key)
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Your Setup

Ensure that your client is correctly authenticated by fetching your user details.

```python
try:
    user = client.get_user()
    print(f"Authenticated as: {user.email}")
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Authentication failed: Invalid API key.")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e}")
```

- **Expected Output:**

  If the API key is valid, you'll see an output similar to:

  ```
  Authenticated as: your_email@example.com
  ```

- **Error Handling:**

  - **AuthenticationError:** Indicates an invalid or expired API key.
  - **APIError:** Covers other API-related issues, such as server errors.

## Usage

The iQ Suite Python SDK offers a variety of functionalities to help you interact with the iQ Suite Platform effectively. This section provides detailed instructions and examples to guide you through different use cases, ensuring that even those new to coding can implement these features with ease.

### Authentication

Before accessing any of the platform's features, you must authenticate using your API key. This process ensures that your requests are secure and authorized.

#### Example: Retrieve Current User Information

This example demonstrates how to verify your authentication by fetching details about the currently authenticated user.

```python
try:
    # Attempt to retrieve the authenticated user's information
    user = client.get_user()
    print(f"Authenticated as: {user.email}")
except AuthenticationError:
    # Handle invalid or expired API keys
    print("Authentication failed: Invalid API key.")
except APIError as e:
    # Handle other API-related errors
    print(f"API Error: {e}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **client.get_user():** Sends a request to the iQ Suite Platform to retrieve information about the authenticated user.
- **AuthenticationError:** Catches errors related to invalid or expired API keys.
- **APIError:** Catches other general API errors.

**Output:**

If successful, the script will print the authenticated user's email address. Otherwise, it will display an appropriate error message.

### Document-based RAG

Document-based RAG involves creating indices from your documents and performing operations like searching, retrieving content, and managing documents within these indices. This section guides you through the various operations you can perform.

#### Create Index

Creating an index allows the platform to process and understand your documents, enabling advanced search and retrieval capabilities.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Information:** *Creating an index is an asynchronous operation. This means the process runs in the background, and you'll receive a task ID to monitor its progress.*

> [!CAUTION]
> To ensure optimal system performance and maintain service quality, create index function calls are subject to rate limiting controls ie, 10 requests per minute..*

##### Example: Create a New Index from a Document

```python
# Open the document you want to index in binary read mode
with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    # Send a request to create an index with the provided document
    response = client.create_index(document=file, filename='document.pdf')
    # Print the received Task ID to monitor progress
    print(f"Task ID: {response.data.task_id}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **open('document.pdf', 'rb'):** Opens the PDF file in binary read mode.
- **client.create_index():** Initiates the index creation process.
- **response.data.task_id:** Receives a unique identifier to track the status of the indexing task.

**Next Steps:**

Use the `Task ID` to monitor the progress of the index creation using polling or webhooks.

#### Create Index with Polling

Polling allows your application to regularly check the status of an asynchronous task until it completes.

##### Example: Create Index and Wait for Completion

```python
try:
    # Open the file in binary mode
    with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:
        # Initiate index creation and wait for it to complete
        response, status = client.create_index_and_poll(
            document=file,          # Pass the binary file object
            filename='document.pdf',# Provide the filename
            poll_interval=20,       # Time in seconds between each poll
            max_retries=10          # Maximum number of polling attempts
        )
    # Print the Index ID once creation is complete
    print(f"Index ID: {response.data.task_id}")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **client.create_index_and_poll():** Combines index creation and polling into a single step.
- **poll_interval:** Defines how frequently the client checks the task status.
- **max_retries:** Limits the number of polling attempts to prevent indefinite waiting.

**Output:**

Once the index is successfully created, the script will display the `Index ID`, which you can use for further operations.

#### Add Document to Index

Adding documents to an existing index allows you to expand the knowledge base your application can query.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Information:** *Adding documents is also an asynchronous process. Ensure that the index you are adding to already exists.*

##### Example: Add a New Document to an Existing Index

```python
try:
    # Open the new document you want to add in binary read mode
    with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:
        # Send a request to add the document to the specified index
        response = client.add_document(
            index_id='your_index_id',      # Use the valid index_id obtained earlier
            document=file,                 # Pass the binary file object
            filename='document.pdf'        # Provide the filename
        )
        # Print the received Task ID to monitor progress
        print(f"Task ID: {response.data.task_id}")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while adding the document: {e}")

```

**Explanation:**

- **index_id='your_index_id':** Replace `'your_index_id'` with your actual Index ID.
- **client.add_document():** Sends a request to add the new document to the specified index.

**Next Steps:**

Use the `Task ID` to monitor the progress of the document addition using polling or webhooks.

#### Add Document with Polling

Wait for the document addition process to complete by periodically checking its status.

##### Example: Add Document and Wait for Completion

```python
try:
    with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as file:
        response, status = client.add_document_and_poll(
            index_id='your_index_id',
            document=file,               # Pass the binary file object
            filename='document.pdf',     # Provide the filename
            poll_interval=20,            # Time in seconds between each poll
            max_retries=10               # Maximum number of polling attempts
        )

    document_id = getattr(status, 'document_id', None)

    print("Document indexing completed")
    print(f"Status Details: {status}")
        
except APIError as e:
    print(f"An API error occurred while adding the document: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **client.add_document_and_poll():** Combines document addition and polling into a single step.
- **document='document.pdf':** Specifies the document to add.
- **poll_interval & max_retries:** Control the polling behavior.

**Output:**

Once the document is successfully added, the script will display the `Document ID`.

#### List Indices

Retrieve a list of all indices you have created. This is useful for managing and selecting the correct index for your operations.

##### Example: List All Indices

```python
try:
    indices = client.list_indexes()
    if not indices:
        print("No indices found.")
    else:
        for index in indices:
            index_id = getattr(index, 'id', None)
            if index_id:
                print(f"Index ID: {index_id}")
            else:
                print("Encountered an index without an ID.")
                
except APIError as e:
    print(f"An API error occurred while listing indexes: {e}")

```json
{
  "event": "index_creation_complete",
  "task_id": "2dca8de9-8a51-497a-9a45-cc6541d4a7bc",
  "index": "08c9ab9f-1b1c-4fc8-8679-a63387654893",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Explanation of Payload Fields:**

- **event:** The type of event that triggered the webhook (e.g., `index_creation_complete`).
- **task_id:** The unique identifier for the task associated with the event.
- **index_id:** The unique identifier for the index associated with the event.
- **status:** The current status of the task (e.g., `completed`, `failed`).

> **üîí Important:** *Always verify webhook signatures in production environments to ensure that incoming requests are genuinely from the iQ Suite Platform and not malicious actors.*

## Tokenizer
The iQ Suite Platform offers a free and unlimited usage of the tokenizer model that you can use to calculate and estimate the token expenditure on the given piece of text

>**NOTE:** The below tokenizer method is rate limitted to 50 requests per minute.

```python
try: 
    response = client.tokenizer(text="hello world")
    print(response.get("tokens_count"))
except APIError as e:
    # Handle any API-related errors
    print(f"Error tokenizing text: {e}")
```

## Supported Documents & Max File Size

The iQ Suite Platform supports a variety of document formats, ensuring flexibility in handling different types of data. Additionally, documents are automatically processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) when applicable, enabling the extraction of text from images or scanned documents. The  **max file size** is capped at  **20 MB** with support for PDF, Docx, PPT.

# Rate Limiting and Request Throttling

To ensure optimal system performance and maintain service quality, below SDK function calls are subject to rate limiting controls. These measures help prevent server overload while ensuring consistent service delivery for all users of the iQ Suite platform.

## Request Limits

The following rate limits are enforced per endpoint:

| Endpoint | Rate Limit |
|----------|------------|
| `rag-create-index` | 10 requests per minute |
| `rag-retrieve-index` | 50 requests per minute |

When these limits are exceeded, requests will be queued and processed according to our throttling algorithm. This helps maintain system stability while maximizing throughput for all users.

Please ensure your application implements appropriate retry logic and respects these rate limits to optimize your integration with the iQ Suite services.

### Supported Formats

1. **PDF Files (.pdf):**
   - **Text-based PDFs:** PDFs that contain selectable text.
   - **Scanned PDFs with OCR Support:** Image-based PDFs that require OCR to extract text.

2. **Microsoft Word Documents:**
   - **Modern Format (.docx):** The current standard format for Word documents.
   - **Legacy Format (.doc):** Older Word document format.

3. **Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations:**
   - **Modern Format (.pptx):** The current standard format for PowerPoint presentations.
   - **Legacy Format (.ppt):** Older PowerPoint presentation format.

### Best Practices for Document Preparation

- **Ensure Proper Formatting:** Well-structured documents with clear headings, subheadings, and consistent formatting improve processing accuracy.
- **Clear and Legible Text:** Especially important for scanned documents, as OCR accuracy depends on text clarity.


## Error Handling

Robust error handling is crucial for building reliable and user-friendly applications. The iQ Suite Python SDK provides specific exceptions to handle various error scenarios effectively.

### Exception Types

- **`AuthenticationError`:** Raised when API authentication fails due to invalid or expired API keys.
- **`RateLimitError`:** Raised when the number of requests exceeds the allowed rate limit.
- **`ValidationError`:** Raised when input parameters are invalid or malformed.
- **`APIError`:** General API-related errors that don't fall under other specific categories.
- **`NetworkError`:** Raised when there are connectivity issues or network-related problems.

### Example: Comprehensive Error Handling

```python
from iqsuite.exceptions import (
    AuthenticationError,
    RateLimitError,
    ValidationError,
    APIError,
    NetworkError
)

try:
    # Attempt to create an index with a document
    result = client.create_index(document='file.pdf')
except AuthenticationError as e:
    # Handle invalid or expired API keys
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except RateLimitError as e:
    # Handle rate limit exceeding
    print(f"Rate limit exceeded. Try again at: {e.reset_at}")
except ValidationError as e:
    # Handle invalid input parameters
    print(f"Invalid input: {e.errors}")
except APIError as e:
    # Handle general API errors
    print(f"API error: {e.message} (Status Code: {e.status_code})")
except NetworkError as e:
    # Handle connectivity issues
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **try-except Blocks:** Each exception type is caught and handled individually to provide specific error messages.
- **Descriptive Messages:** Informative messages help in understanding the nature of the error and possible remediation steps.

### Common HTTP Status Codes

Understanding HTTP status codes can aid in diagnosing issues when interacting with the API.

- **`400 Bad Request`:** The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. *Action:* Check your input parameters.
- **`401 Unauthorized`:** Authentication failed. *Action:* Verify your API key.
- **`403 Forbidden`:** You don't have the necessary permissions to access the resource. *Action:* Check your account permissions.
- **`404 Not Found`:** The requested resource does not exist. *Action:* Ensure the resource ID is correct.
- **`429 Too Many Requests`:** You've exceeded the allowed rate limit. *Action:* Wait before making more requests.
- **`500 Internal Server Error`:** The server encountered an unexpected condition. *Action:* Contact support.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** *Always implement proper error handling in your application to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully and enhance user experience.*
