deck.shuffle()
print(deck.cards)

# [3♦, A♦, 8♥, 5♠, 6♣, 6♦, 5♥, T♣, 8♣, 7♥, 4♠, 2♦, Q♥, K♥, 8♦, 6♠, A♠, A♣, T♥, K♦, 7♦, 9♠, 3♥, 5♦, J♣, 2♥, 4♦, 9♦, 3♠, A♥, K♠, 9♥, 2♣, K♣, 2♠, J♥, J♦, Q♠, 4♥, 3♣, T♦, 5♣, 7♠, 6♥, 8♠, T♠, Q♣, 9♣, 4♣, J♠, 7♣, Q♦]

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

# Check if the deck contains the Ace of Spades
print("Ace of Spades exists:", deck.card_exists(card=pc.ACE_SPADES))

# Remove the Ace of Spades from the deck
deck.remove_card(card=pc.ACE_SPADES)

# Check if the deck contains the Ace of Spades after removal
print("Ace of Spades exists:", deck.card_exists(card=pc.ACE_SPADES))

# Ace of Spades exists: True
# Ace of Spades removed: False

```

#### Count number of cards in the deck
```python
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()
print("Number of cards in the deck:", deck.count())

# Number of cards in the deck: 52

```

#### Empty the deck
```python
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()
deck.cards = []
print("Number of cards in the deck:", deck.count())

# Number of cards in the deck: 0

```

#### Reset the deck

deck = Deck()

deck.shuffle()
print("After shuffle:", deck)

deck.reset()
print("After reset:", deck)

```

#### Count by suite

import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()
spades_count = deck.count_by_suite(pc.SPADES)
print("Spades in the deck:", spades_count)

# Spades in the deck: 13

```

#### Draw Card

Draws a given card from the deck if it exists. If not exists then raises `CardError` exception.

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

card = deck.draw_card(card=pc.ACE_SPADES)
print(card)

# A♠

```

#### Draw Card at Index

Draws card at given index if the index exists.
If the index does not exist then raises `IndexError`

```python
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

print("Card at index 33:", deck.cards[33])
card = deck.draw_card_at_index(index=33)
print("Drawn card", card)

# Card at index 33: 8♣
# Drawn card 8♣

```

#### Draw Random Card

Draws a random card from the deck. If the deck is empty, then raises `NotEnoughCardsError`

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

random_card = deck.draw_random_card()
print("Random Card:", random_card)
print("Cards in the deck:", len(deck))

# Random Card: K♦
# Cards in the deck: 51
```

#### Draw Random Cards

Draws given number of cards from the deck.
If the number is greater than the number of cards in the deck, then `NotEnoughCardsError` exception is raised

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

random_cards = deck.draw_random_cards(number_of_cards=2)
print("Random Cards:", random_cards)
print("Cards in the deck:", len(deck))

# Random Cards: [Q♣, 3♠]
# Cards in the deck: 50
```

#### Deal Multi Players

Deals cards to multiple players

```python
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

player_cards_0 = deck.deal_multi_players(
    number_of_players=4,
    number_of_cards=2
)

deck.reset()

player_cards_1 = deck.deal_multi_players(
    number_of_players=4,
    number_of_cards=2,
    shuffle_deck=False
)

print("player_cards_0:", player_cards_0)
print("player_cards_1:", player_cards_1)

# player_cards_0: {0: [2♥, 7♦], 1: [9♦, J♣], 2: [T♣, 2♣], 3: [J♠, J♦]}
# player_cards_1: {0: [A♠, 2♠], 1: [3♠, 4♠], 2: [5♠, 6♠], 3: [7♠, 8♠]}

```

#### Missing Cards

Returns the list of cards which are missing in the deck

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

# Removing Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts
deck.remove_cards([
    pc.JACK_SPADES,
    pc.JACK_HEARTS
])

print(deck.missing_cards())

# [J♠, J♥]

```

#### Count by card type
```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()
aces_count = deck.count_by_card_type(pc.ACE)
print("Spades in the deck:", aces_count)

# Aces in the deck: 4
```

#### Count by card
```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

print("Ace of Spades in deck:", deck.count_by_card(card=pc.ACE_SPADES))

# Ace of Spades in deck: 1
```

#### Add card in the deck

By default, the `duplicate_allowed` is set to `False`

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()
deck.add_card(card=pc.ACE_SPADES, duplicate_allowed=True)

ace_count = deck.count_by_card_type(pc.ACE)
print("Aces in the deck:", ace_count)

spades_count = deck.count_by_suite(pc.SPADES)
print("Spades in the deck:", spades_count)

# Aces in the deck: 5
# Spades in the deck: 14

```

If we try to run the same code with `duplicate_allowed = False` then `CardError` exception will be raised.


#### Add multiple cards

Adds multiple cards at once.

`duplicate_allowed` is also applicable to this function. The default is `False`

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

# Emptying the deck
deck.cards = []

# Cards to be added
cards = [pc.ACE_SPADES, pc.KING_SPADES, pc.QUEEN_SPADES, pc.JACK_SPADES]

deck.add_cards(cards=cards)
print(deck)

# [A♠, K♠, Q♠, J♠]

```

#### Add card at given index

Adds card at given index.

`duplicate_allowed` is also applicable to this function. The default is `False`

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

deck.cards = [
    pc.ACE_SPADES, pc.QUEEN_SPADES
]

print("Cards before adding:", deck)
deck.add_card_at_index(card=pc.KING_SPADES, index=1)
print("Cards after adding:", deck)

# Cards before adding: [A♠, Q♠]
# Cards after adding: [A♠, K♠, Q♠]

```

#### Remove Card

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

deck.remove_card(pc.ACE_SPADES)

print("Cards in the deck:", len(deck))

# Cards in the deck: 51

```

#### Remove Card at Index

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

# Removing Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts
card_at_index_14 = deck.cards[14]
deck.remove_card_at_index(14)

print("Card at index 14:", card_at_index_14)
print(deck.missing_cards())

# Card at index 14: 2♥
# [2♥]

```

#### Remove Cards

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

# Removing Jack of Spades and Jack of Hearts
cards = [pc.JACK_SPADES, pc.JACK_HEARTS]
deck.remove_cards(cards=cards)
print(deck.missing_cards())

# [J♠, J♥]

```

#### Remove cards by suite

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

deck.remove_suite(pc.SPADES)

print("Cards in the deck:", len(deck))

# Cards in the deck: 39

```

##### Remove Cards by Type

```python
import playing_card_utils as pc
from playing_card_utils.deck import Deck

deck = Deck()

deck.remove_card_type(card_type=pc.SIX)

print("Cards in the deck:", len(deck))

# Cards in the deck: 48
