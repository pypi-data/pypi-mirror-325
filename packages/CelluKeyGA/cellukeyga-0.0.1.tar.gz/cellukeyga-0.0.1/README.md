# CelluKeyGA

🚀 **CelluKeyGA** is a Python library that integrates **Cellular Genetic Algorithm (Cellular GA)** with **Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)** to enhance optimization capabilities. This project aims to provide a flexible and efficient evolutionary computing framework for solving complex optimization problems.

## 🔹 Features
- Combines **Cellular GA** and **BRKGA** for improved solution diversity and performance.
- Designed for solving **combinatorial and continuous optimization** problems.
- **Modular and extensible** structure for easy customization.

## 🛠️ Applications
CelluKeyGA can be applied in various domains, including:
- ✅ Scheduling and routing problems.
- ✅ Machine learning hyperparameter optimization.
- ✅ Engineering design optimization.
- ✅ Any problem requiring robust metaheuristic search strategies.

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install cellukeyga 
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
```python
from cellukeyga import CelluKeyGA

# Example usage
ckga = CelluKeyGA()
ckga.run()
```

## 📂 Roadmap
- [ ] Implement core algorithm.
- [ ] Add benchmark test problems.
- [ ] Provide detailed documentation.
- [ ] Integrate with pymoo.
