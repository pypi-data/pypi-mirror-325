# AlphaRING

AlphaRING is a customised implementation of [AlphaFold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) and [RING](https://ring.biocomputingup.it/) designed to predict the pathogenicity of any missense variant. 

To predict the pathogenicity of a missense variant, AlphaRING performs the following steps: 

1. Predicts the wild-type and variant protein structures.
2. Captures the wild-type and variant non-covalent bonds.
3. Uses changes in non-covalent bond formation by the variable residue to predict pathogenicity.

Therefore, AlphaRING is both scalable and transparent, enabling researchers to obtain explicit, biophysically-based predictions of the pathogenicity of missense variants.

## Overview

Here is an overview of the three-step AlphaRING workflow:

1. **Predict the wild-type and variant protein structures**:

   Firstly, AlphaRING accepts two protein FASTA files representing a wild-type:variant pair and predicts the structures of both using AlphaFold. The FASTA files must differ by exactly one residue.

   Here is an example of a pair of FASTA files representing proteins called "wildtype" and "variant", which differ only at residue three:

   ```
   >wildtype
   MKTAY
   ```
   
   ```
   >variant
   MKMAY
   ```

2. **Capture the wild-type and variant non-covalent bonds**:

   Secondly, AlphaRING passes the predicted structures of the wild-type and variant proteins to RING to capture the energies, distances, and geometries of the non-covalent bonds within both structures.

3. **Use changes in non-covalent bond formation by the variable residue to predict pathogenicity**:

   Thirdly, AlphaRING uses the changes in non-covalent bond formation by the variable residue (along with the predicted accuracy of the wild-type structure at the position of the variable residue) in novel formulas to calculate a singular numerical metric: AlphaRING score. A greater change in non-covalent bond formation corresponds to a higher AlphaRING score, i.e., greater missense variant pathogenicity.

## Usage

To predict the pathogenicity of a missense variant, activate the AlphaRING environment and execute the `run_alpharing` command as follows:

```bash
conda activate alpharing
run_alpharing \
  --fasta_paths=/path/to/wildtype/fasta,/path/to/variant/fasta \
  --output_dir=/path/to/output/ \
  --data_dir=/path/to/alphafold/database/ \
  --max_template_date=yyyy-mm-dd \
  --use_gpu_relax=True or False \
```

> [!WARNING]
> For correct functioning, ensure the wild-type FASTA file is listed before the variant in `--fasta_paths`. For more information on running AlphaRING, execute `run_alpharing --helpfull` in the activated environment.

## Downstream

AlphaRING stores the output for the wild-type and variant proteins in separate subdirectories within the directory specified by `--output_dir`. Each subdirectory is named after the basename of the FASTA file from which it was produced. Both subdirectories contain the default AlphaFold and RING outputs. Additionally, the variant subdirectory contains the file `alpharing_score.txt`, which stores the AlphaRING score of the variant.

Here is the structure of a wild-type or variant output subdirectory produced from a FASTA file named "wildtype.fa" or "variant.fa" respectively:

```
{wildtype|variant}/              
   alpharing_score.txt                                # only in variant

   timings.json                                       # AlphaFold
   unrelaxed_model_{1,2,3,4,5}_pred_0.cif             # AlphaFold
   unrelaxed_model_{1,2,3,4,5}_pred_0.pdb             # AlphaFold
```
> [!NOTE]
> To save time and avoid redundancy, when running a prediction, AlphaRING will check both FASTA files for an existing corresponding output subdirectory containing a relaxed model PDB file, and will skip the AlphaFold stage only for the FASTA files that do. This feature is especially useful for consecutive AlphaRING predictions when the wild-type FASTA file remains unchanged but the variant FASTA file varies.
