redis-jwt-auth

A FastAPI Middleware for Secure JWT Authentication with Redis Caching

Overview

redis-jwt-auth is a FastAPI middleware that provides JWT authentication with Redis-based token caching. It enhances performance by reducing database queries and ensures single active sessions per user. The package supports token rotation, secure session management, and seamless integration into FastAPI applications.

Key Features

âœ… JWT Token Validation â€“ Decodes and verifies JWT tokens efficiently.

âœ… Redis Caching â€“ Stores access tokens, refresh tokens, and user objects in Redis for fast retrieval.

âœ… Single Active Session â€“ Ensures a user is logged in from only one device at a time.

âœ… Token Rotation (Optional) â€“ Enhances security by refreshing tokens on every request.

âœ… Soft-Delete Support â€“ Ensures inactive or deleted users cannot authenticate.

âœ… Easy Middleware Integration â€“ Plug and play support for FastAPI applications.

Installation

Install redis-jwt-auth using pip:

pip install redis-jwt-auth

Usage

1. Initialize Middleware in FastAPI

from fastapi import FastAPI
from redis_jwt_auth.middleware import TokenMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    TokenMiddleware,
    redis_host="localhost",
    redis_port=6379,
    secret_key="your_jwt_secret",
    enable_token_rotation=True  # Set to False if you don't want token rotation
)

2. Protect Routes

Use the middleware to protect routes automatically. The validated user will be available in request.state.user.

from fastapi import Depends, Request

@app.get("/protected-route")
async def protected_route(request: Request):
    user = request.state.user  # Retrieved from Redis cache
    return {"message": f"Welcome, {user['username']}!"}

3. Redis Caching Structure

Action

Description

On login

Tokens and user details are stored in Redis.

On request

JWT is validated, checked against Redis, and user details are fetched.

On logout

Tokens are deleted from Redis, ensuring session invalidation.
