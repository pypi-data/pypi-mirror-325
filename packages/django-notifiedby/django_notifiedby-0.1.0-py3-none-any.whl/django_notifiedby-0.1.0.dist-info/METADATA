email = EmailMessage(
    subject='Subject Here',
    body='Body of the email here',
    from_email='your_email@example.com',
    to=['recipient@example.com'],  # List of recipients
    cc=['cc_recipient@example.com'],  # CC
    bcc=['bcc_recipient@example.com'],  # BCC
)

# Attach a file?
email.attach('example.pdf', b'Some binary data', 'application/pdf')
email.send()
