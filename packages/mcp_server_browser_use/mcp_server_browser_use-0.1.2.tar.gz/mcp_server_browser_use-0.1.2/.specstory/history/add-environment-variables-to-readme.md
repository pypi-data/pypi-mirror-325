## Add Environment Variables to README (07/02/2025, 13:03:52)

_**User**_

add these env vars to readme:


        "BROWSER_HEADLESS": "false",
        "BROWSER_DISABLE_SECURITY": "false",
        "BROWSER_WINDOW_WIDTH": "1280",
        "BROWSER_WINDOW_HEIGHT": "720",
        "BROWSER_TRACE_PATH": "trace.json",
        "BROWSER_RECORDING_PATH": "recording.mp4"

<thinking>
Let me analyze how to best add these environment variables to the README:

1. Core requirement: Add new browser-related environment variables to the configuration section
2. Implementation approaches:
   - Add as a new section specifically for browser config
   - Merge into existing env vars list
   - Add to troubleshooting section

3. Decision: Add to existing env vars list since they're part of the same configuration block
4. Verification:
   - Clear to junior devs? Yes, grouped with related browser settings
   - Unnecessary abstractions? No
   - Can be simpler? No, direct and clear
</thinking>

I'll edit the README.md to add these environment variables to the configuration section. I'll place them with the other browser-related settings for better organization.

I've added the new browser-related environment variables to the configuration section of the README. I placed them alongside other browser and Chrome-related settings for better organization and readability. The variables are now documented in the configuration block and maintain the same formatting style as the existing entries.

These new variables provide additional control over:
- Browser headless mode
- Security settings
- Window dimensions
- Debug tracing
- Session recording

The changes have been successfully applied to the README.md file. Is there anything else you'd like me to add or clarify about these new environment variables?
