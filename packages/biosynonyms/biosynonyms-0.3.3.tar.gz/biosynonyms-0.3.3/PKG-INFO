        Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
        and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
        authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
        the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
        scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
        of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
        works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
        and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
        These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
        culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
        works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
        part through the use and efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
        expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
        associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
        is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
        elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
        terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
        Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
        
        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
        limited to, the following:
        
          i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
             communicate, and translate a Work;
         ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
             likeness depicted in a Work;
         iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
             subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
          v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
             in a Work;
         vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
             European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
             protection of databases, and under any national implementation
             thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
             directive); and
        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
             world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
             implementations thereof.
        
        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
        of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
        irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
        of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
        future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
        worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
        treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
        medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
        including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
        purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
        member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
        revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
        equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
        as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
        be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
        Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
        account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
        person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
        irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
        Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
        time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
        of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
        limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
        "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
        reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
        partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
        of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
        will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
        Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
        action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
        express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        
         a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
            surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
         b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
            the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
         c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
            that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
            limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
            Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
            consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.
         d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
            party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
            this CC0 or use of the Work.

A decentralized database of synonyms for biomedical entities and concepts. This
resource is meant to be complementary to ontologies, databases, and other
controlled vocabularies that provide synonyms. It's released under a permissive
license (CC0), so they can be easily adopted by/contributed back to upstream
resources.

Here's how to get the data:

```python
import biosynonyms

# Uses an internal data structure
positive_synonyms = biosynonyms.get_positive_synonyms()
negative_synonyms = biosynonyms.get_negative_synonyms()

# Get ready for use in NER with Gilda, only using positive synonyms
gilda_terms = biosynonyms.get_gilda_terms()
```

### Synonyms

The data are also accessible directly through TSV such that anyone can consume
them from any programming language.

The [`positives.tsv`](src/biosynonyms/resources/positives.tsv) has the following
columns:

1. `text` the synonym text itself
2. `curie` the compact uniform resource identifier (CURIE) for a biomedical
   entity or concept, standardized using the Bioregistry
3. `name` the standard name for the concept
4. `predicate` the predicate which encodes the synonym scope, written as a CURIE
   from the [OBO in OWL (`oboInOWL`)](https://bioregistry.io/oio) or RDFS
   controlled vocabularies, e.g., one of:
   - `rdfs:label`
   - `oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym`
   - `oboInOwl:hasNarrowSynonym` (i.e., the synonym represents a narrower term)
   - `oboInOwl:hasBroadSynonym` (i.e., the synonym represents a broader term)
   - `oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym` (use this if the scope is unknown)
5. `type` the (optional) synonym property type, written as a CURIE from the
   [OBO Metadata Ontology (`omo`)](https://bioregistry.io/omo) controlled
   vocabulary, e.g., one of:
   - `OMO:0003000` (abbreviation)
   - `OMO:0003001` (ambiguous synonym)
   - `OMO:0003002` (dubious synonym)
   - `OMO:0003003` (layperson synonym)
   - `OMO:0003004` (plural form)
   - ...
6. `provenance` a comma-delimited list of CURIEs corresponding to publications
   that use the given synonym (ideally using highly actionable identifiers from
   semantic spaces like [`pubmed`](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed),
   [`pmc`](https://bioregistry.io/pmc), [`doi`](https://bioregistry.io/doi))
7. `contributor` a CURIE with the ORCID identifier of the contributor
8. `date` the optional date when the row was curated in YYYY-MM-DD format
9. `language` the (optional) ISO 2-letter language code. If missing, assumed to
   be American English.
10. `comment` an optional comment
11. `source` the source of the synonyms, usually `biosynonyms` unless imported
    from elsewhere

Here's an example of some rows in the synonyms table (with linkified CURIEs):

| text            | curie                                               | predicate                                                                   | provenance                                                                                                           | contributor                                                                   | language |

### Incorrect Synonyms

The [`negatives.tsv`](src/biosynonyms/resources/negatives.tsv) has the following
columns for non-trivial examples of text strings that aren't synonyms. This
document doesn't address the same issues as context-based disambiguation, but
rather helps describe issues like incorrect sub-string matching:

1. `text` the non-synonym text itself
2. `curie` the compact uniform resource identifier (CURIE) for a biomedical
   entity or concept that **does not** match the following text, standardized
   using the Bioregistry
3. `references` same as for `positives.tsv`, illustrating documents where this
   string appears
4. `contributor` the ORCID identifier of the contributor
5. `language` the (optional) ISO 2-letter language code. If missing, assumed to
   be American English.

Here's an example of some rows in the negative synonyms table (with linkified
CURIEs):

| text        | curie                                           | provenance                                                                                                           | contributor                                                                   | language |

## Known Limitations

It's hard to know which exact matches between different vocabularies could be
used to deduplicate synonyms. Right now, this isn't covered but some partial
solutions already exist that could be adopted.

The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a
code contribution.

### Development Installation

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
git clone git+https://github.com/biopragmatics/biosynonyms.git
cd biosynonyms
pip install -e .
```

### Updating Package Boilerplate

This project uses `cruft` to keep boilerplate (i.e., configuration, contribution
guidelines, documentation configuration) up-to-date with the upstream
cookiecutter package. Update with the following:

```shell
pip install cruft
cruft update
```

More info on Cruft's update command is available
[here](https://github.com/cruft/cruft?tab=readme-ov-file#updating-a-project).

### 🥼 Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox tox-uv`,
the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be run reproducibly with:

```shell
tox -e py
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/biopragmatics/biosynonyms/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### 📖 Building the Documentation

The documentation can be built locally using the following:

```shell
git clone git+https://github.com/biopragmatics/biosynonyms.git
cd biosynonyms
tox -e docs
open docs/build/html/index.html
```

The documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs` extra
specified in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). `sphinx` plugins like
`texext` can be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the
`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).

The documentation can be deployed to [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.io) using
[this guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html). The
[`.readthedocs.yml`](../../Desktop/biosynonyms/.readthedocs.yml) YAML file
contains all the configuration you'll need. You can also set up continuous
integration on GitHub to check not only that Sphinx can build the documentation
in an isolated environment (i.e., with `tox -e docs-test`) but also that
[ReadTheDocs can build it too](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html).

#### Configuring ReadTheDocs

1. Log in to ReadTheDocs with your GitHub account to install the integration at
   https://readthedocs.org/accounts/login/?next=/dashboard/
2. Import your project by navigating to https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/import
   then clicking the plus icon next to your repository
3. You can rename the repository on the next screen using a more stylized name
   (i.e., with spaces and capital letters)
4. Click next, and you're good to go!

### 📦 Making a Release

#### Configuring Zenodo

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) is a long-term archival system that assigns a DOI
to each release of your package.

1. Log in to Zenodo via GitHub with this link:
   https://zenodo.org/oauth/login/github/?next=%2F. This brings you to a page
   that lists all of your organizations and asks you to approve installing the
   Zenodo app on GitHub. Click "grant" next to any organizations you want to
   enable the integration for, then click the big green "approve" button. This
   step only needs to be done once.
2. Navigate to https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/, which lists all of
   your GitHub repositories (both in your username and any organizations you
   enabled). Click the on/off toggle for any relevant repositories. When you
   make a new repository, you'll have to come back to this

After these steps, you're ready to go! After you make "release" on GitHub (steps
for this are below), you can navigate to
https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/biopragmatics/biosynonyms
to see the DOI for the release and link to the Zenodo record for it.

#### Registering with the Python Package Index (PyPI)

You only have to do the following steps once.

1. Register for an account on the
   [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/account/register)
2. Navigate to https://pypi.org/manage/account and make sure you have verified
   your email address. A verification email might not have been sent by default,
   so you might have to click the "options" dropdown next to your address to get
   to the "re-send verification email" button
3. 2-Factor authentication is required for PyPI since the end of 2023 (see this
   [blog post from PyPI](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-25-securing-pypi-with-2fa/)).
   This means you have to first issue account recovery codes, then set up
   2-factor authentication
4. Issue an API token from https://pypi.org/manage/account/token

#### Configuring your machine's connection to PyPI

You have to do the following steps once per machine. Create a file in your home
directory called `.pypirc` and include the following:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <the API token you just got>

# This block is optional in case you want to be able to make test releases to the Test PyPI server
[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = <an API token from test PyPI>
```

Note that since PyPI is requiring token-based authentication, we use `__token__`
as the user, verbatim. If you already have a `.pypirc` file with a `[distutils]`
section, just make sure that there is an `index-servers` key and that `pypi` is
in its associated list. More information on configuring the `.pypirc` file can
be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc).

#### Uploading to PyPI

After installing the package in development mode and installing `tox` with
`pip install tox tox-uv`, run the following from the shell:

```shell
tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to
   switch the version number in the `pyproject.toml`, `CITATION.cff`,
   `src/biosynonyms/version.py`, and
   [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel using
   [`uv build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/#building-your-package)
3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine).
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the
   version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump
   the version by minor, you can use `tox -e bumpversion -- minor` after.

#### Releasing on GitHub

1. Navigate to https://github.com/biopragmatics/biosynonyms/releases/new to
   draft a new release
2. Click the "Choose a Tag" dropdown and select the tag corresponding to the
   release you just made
3. Click the "Generate Release Notes" button to get a quick outline of recent
   changes. Modify the title and description as you see fit
4. Click the big green "Publish Release" button

This will trigger Zenodo to assign a DOI to your release as well.
