Collection of image processing tools and techniques, including padding, flipping, colorscale conversion, seam carving, and image shrinking. Designed for efficient manipulation and transformation of images.

## Summary

This package provides a comprehensive set of image processing utilities tailored for seamless integration of image manipulation projects. It includes essential tools for image transformations, seam carving, and processing. This package enables users to efficiently prepare, manipulate and modify image based on the needs of the user. The `sharpedge` package is valuable for users seeking tools for resizing and compressing images while maintaining visual content integrity.

## Functions

- **`reposition_image`**  
  This function allows you to manipulate the position and orientation of an image by flipping, rotating, or shifting it. You can customize the actions based on your needs, such as horizontal flips, rotation to the left or right, or shifting the image along the X and Y axes.

- **`frame_image`**  
  Enhance the aesthetic of your image by adding a decorative frame around it. The frame can be customized with adjustable border sizes, placement inside or outside the image, and a specified color for the border.

- **`modulate_image`**  
  Modify the color channels of an image to achieve effects like grayscale conversion or specific channel isolation. This function is useful for color manipulation tasks, including transforming RGB images to simpler formats for analysis or artistic purposes.

- **`pooling_image`**  
  Apply pooling techniques to an image using a defined window size and a specified function, such as mean or max pooling. Pooling is commonly used to reduce image dimensions while preserving key features, making it especially relevant for preprocessing in computer vision tasks.

- **`pca_compression`**  
  Compress an image using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by retaining only the most significant features while discarding less important data. This method is ideal for reducing file size while preserving a specified proportion of the original variance in the image.

- **`seam_carve`**  
  Resize an image intelligently using seam carving to preserve important content while adjusting dimensions. This technique minimizes distortion by removing or inserting paths of least importance, making it effective for content-aware resizing.

## Where This Fits in the Python Ecosystem

This package fits into the broader Python image ecosystem, along with packages like [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). While OpenCV and Pillow provide general-purpose image processing tools, and scikit-learn includes PCA for dimensionality reduction, this package stands out for its simplicity and streamlined functionality. It specializes in content-aware resizing and transformations, focusing on practical utilities for advanced image manipulations. It offers unique capabilities, allowing users to accomplish tasks quickly without needing to manage complex parameters.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install sharpedge
```

## Usage

For detailed explanations, tutorials, and image examples for each function, visit [our official documentation](https://sharpedge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

To harness the image processing magic of SharpEdge, follow these steps:

1. Import the required functions from the package:

    ```python
    from sharpedge import reposition_image
    from sharpedge import frame_image
    from sharpedge import modulate_image
    from sharpedge import pooling_image
    from sharpedge import pca_compression
    from sharpedge import seam_carve
    ```

2. (Optional) Load your image as a NumPy array (if it isn't already).

      ```python
      # Ensure that you have Pillow and numpy installed in your environment
      from PIL import Image
      import numpy as np

      # Load the image from the given path
      img = np.array(Image.open(PATH_TO_IMAGE))
      ```

3. Process your images using the available functions:
   - Flip, rotate, and shift an image based on the specified requested action：

        ```python
        # Flip horizontally, rotate left, and shift the image
        repositioned_img = reposition_image(img, flip='horizontal', rotate='left', shift_x=10, shift_y=20)
        ```

   - Add a decorative frame around the image with customizable color:

        ```python
        # Add a frame around your image
        framed_img = frame_image(img, h_border=30, w_border=30, inside=True, color=255)
        ```

   - Convert or manipulate image color channels:

        ```python
        # Convert an RGB image to grayscale
        grayscale_image = modulate_image(rgb_image, mode='gray')
        ```

   - Perform pooling on an image using a specified window size and pooling function:

        ```python
        # Perform pooling on an image with mean pooling function
        pooled_img = pooling_image(img, window_size=10, func=np.mean)
        ```

   - Compress the input image using Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

        ```python
        # Compress a grayscale image by retaining 80% of the variance
        compressed_img = pca_compression(grayscale_img, preservation_rate=0.8)
        ```

   - Resize the image using seam carving to the target dimensions:

        ```python
        # Seam carve an image to resize it to the target dimensions
        resized_img = seam_carve(img, target_height=300, target_width=400)
        ```
