## 0.8.x
### 0.8.5: Patch for New PyPiUpdater Version
- **PyPiUpdater 0.5** introduced breaking changes; adjusted code to ensure compatibility with the new version.

### 0.8.4: Minor Enhancements & Cleanup
- Updated window titles.
- Improved error handling for updater: now displays the specific error message instead of just **"error"** when an issue occurs during update checks.
- Ensured all child windows close when the main window is closed.

### 0.8.3: Fix – OptimaLab35 Not Closing After Update
- Fixed an issue where **OptimaLab35** would not close properly when updating, resulting in an unresponsive instance and multiple running processes.

### 0.8.2: Patch for New PyPiUpdater Version
- Updated to support **PyPiUpdater 0.4.0**.
- Now stores version information locally, preventing an "unknown" state on the first updater launch.
  - Users still need to press the **Update** button to verify the latest version, ensuring an internet connection is available.

### 0.8.1: Fix
- Fixed a misspelling of `PyPiUpdater` in the build file, which prevented v0.8.0 from being installed.

### 0.8.0: Updater Feature
- Added an updater function utilizing my new package [PyPiUpdater](https://gitlab.com/CodeByMrFinchum/PyPiUpdater).
- New updater window displaying the local version and checking for updates online.
- Added an option to update and restart the app from the menu.

## 0.7.0: Enhanced Preview
- Images loaded into the preview window are now scaled while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Added live updates: changes to brightness, contrast, or grayscale are applied immediately.
  - This may crush the system depending on image size and system specifications.
- Removed Settings from menuBar, and extended the about window.

---

## 0.6.0: Initial Flatpak Support
- Started Flatpak package building.
- Not added to Flathub yet, as only stable software is hosted there.
- Not fully completed, icon, name, and description are included, but the version is missing for some reason.
- Local build and installation work. The Bash script `build_flatpak.sh` in the `flatpak/` directory generates all pip dependencies, then builds and installs the app locally.
- `requirements-parser` has to be installed from pip to finish installing the flatpak (maybe more pypi packages..)

---

## 0.5.0
- Removed all leftover of tui code that was hiding in some classes.

---

## 0.4.0
- Fixed a critical issue that prevented the program from functioning.
- Updated compatibility to align with the **upcoming** optima35 **release**.

**Removal of TUI:**
- The TUI version is no longer compatible with optima35 v1.0.
- Maintaining two UIs has become too time-consuming, as the primary focus is on the GUI, which provides the best user experience. Recently, the TUI version was only receiving patches without any meaningful enhancements.
