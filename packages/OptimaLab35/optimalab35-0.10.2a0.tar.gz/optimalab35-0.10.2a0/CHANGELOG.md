- Started Flatpak package building.
- Not added to Flathub yet, as only stable software is hosted there.
- Not fully completed, icon, name, and description are included, but the version is missing for some reason.
- Local build and installation work. The Bash script `build_flatpak.sh` in the `flatpak/` directory generates all pip dependencies, then builds and installs the app locally.
- `requirements-parser` has to be installed from pip to finish installing the flatpak (maybe more pypi packages..)

---

## 0.5.0
- Removed all leftover of tui code that was hiding in some classes.

---

## 0.4.0
- Fixed a critical issue that prevented the program from functioning.
- Updated compatibility to align with the **upcoming** optima35 **release**.

**Removal of TUI:**
- The TUI version is no longer compatible with optima35 v1.0.
- Maintaining two UIs has become too time-consuming, as the primary focus is on the GUI, which provides the best user experience. Recently, the TUI version was only receiving patches without any meaningful enhancements.
