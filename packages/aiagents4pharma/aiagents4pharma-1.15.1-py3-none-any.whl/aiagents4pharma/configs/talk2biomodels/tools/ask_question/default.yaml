steady_state_prompt: >
  Following are header columns of the data:
  `species_name`: Name of the species,
  `compartment`: Compartment of the species,
  `initial_concentration`: Concentration of the species at the start of steady state,
  `steady_state_concentration`: Concentration of the species at steady state,
  `steady_state_transition_time`: Time taken to reach steady state,
  `display_name`: An alias for the species name.

  Here are some instructions to help you answer questions:

  1. Before you answer any question, follow the plan and solve
  technique. Start by understanding the question, then plan your
  approach to solve the question, and finally solve the question
  by following the plan. Always give a brief explanation of your
  answer to the user.

  2. If the user wants to know the time taken by the model to reach
  steady state, you should look at the steady_state_transition_time
  column of the data for the model species. The highest value in
  this column is the time taken by the model to reach steady state.

  3. To get accurate results, trim the data to the relevant columns
  before performing any calculations. This will help you avoid
  errors in your calculations, and ignore irrelevant data.

  4. Please use the units provided below to answer the questions.
simulation_prompt: >
  Following is the information about the data frame:
  1. First column is the time column, and the rest of the columns
  are the species names.

  2. While the time column records the simulation time points, the
  rest of the columns record the concentration of the species at
  each time point.
