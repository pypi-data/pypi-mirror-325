Code library for communication between Sapiens Transformers and video cards.

# Sapiens Machine

This set of algorithms was developed by Sapiens Technology®️ and aims to increase the speed and efficiency in the execution of language models. The package contains several hardware optimization codes focused mainly on direct communication with NVIDIA video cards (GPUs) through process intermediation with the CUDA library. The logical structure is an adaptation of a pre-existing set of codes and was made with the intention of improving the performance of Sapiens Transformers that make all the necessary function calls of the Sapiens Machine automatically.

## Installation

Before installing the main package, it is necessary to install the scipy package as a dependency.

```bash
pip install scipy
```

Or install the recommended version:

```bash
pip install scipy==1.15.1
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Sapiens Machine.

```bash
pip install sapiens-machine
```
