    """
    Merges multiple dictionaries containing lists into a single dictionary, with options to handle duplicates,
    list ordering, and erroneous data types.

    Parameters:
        *dictionaryLists: Variable number of dictionaries to be merged. If only one dictionary is passed, it will be processed based on the provided options.
        destroyDuplicates (False): If True, removes duplicate elements from the lists. Defaults to False.
        ignoreListOrdering (False): If True, sorts the lists. Defaults to False.
        killErroneousDataTypes (False): If True, skips lists that cause a TypeError during merging. Defaults to False.
    Returns:
        ePluribusUnum: A single dictionary with merged lists based on the provided options. If only one dictionary is passed,
        it will be cleaned up based on the options.
    Note:
        The returned value, `ePluribusUnum`, is a so-called primitive dictionary (`typing.Dict`). Furthermore, every dictionary key is a
        so-called primitive string (cf. `str()`) and every dictionary value is a so-called primitive list (`typing.List`). If `dictionaryLists`
        has other data types, the data types will not be preserved. That could have unexpected consequences: in some cases, for example, conversion
        from the original data type to a `typing.List` will not preserve the order even if you want the order preserved.
