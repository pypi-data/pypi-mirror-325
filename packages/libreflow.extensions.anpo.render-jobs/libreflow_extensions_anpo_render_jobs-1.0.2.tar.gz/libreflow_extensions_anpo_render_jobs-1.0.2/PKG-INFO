## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-05

### Added

* An action for batch rendering Blender animspline files.
    * It fetches the latest available revision of each animspline task in the project.
    * If a movie has been created by another site, you can try to download it.
        * When the file is not available on the exchange server, the shot will be marked as "ready to re-render" on the current site.
    * Depending on how many shots are left to render, the first loading of the action may take a while.
        * For example, 400 shots can take up to a minute.
