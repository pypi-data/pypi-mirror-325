v23.11.1
--------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix a memory leak in functions such as :func:`scipp.bin` and :func:`scipp.group` that affects Scipp versions between 23.08.0 and 23.11.0 `#3342 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3342>`_.

v23.11.0
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Operations on binned variables with a data array content buffer now also work with slices of binned variables `#3282 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3282>`_.

* Event-centric arithmetic now uses the correct dtype in the result `#3278 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3278>`_.
* Fixed a serious bug where operations on, e.g., transposed binned data resulted in corrupt coord, mask, and attr values of the bin contents `#3282 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3282>`_.
* ``min`` and ``max`` now return not-a-number if any input element is not-a-number instead of ignoring that element `#3299 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3299>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed the "What's new" page because it had not been updated in a while and Scipp changes less drastically now `#3296 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3296>`_.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``scipp.DataArray.attrs`` and all related methods and properties have been deprecated `#3227 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3227>`_.

* Handle alignment of coordinates in operations `#3153 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3153>`_.
* ``sc.compat.from_pandas`` now has additional arguments `#3169 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3169>`_.
* Added ``sc.io.load_csv`` `#3169 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3169>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v23.05.0
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* :class:`scipp.DataArray` now supports ``assign_coords``/ ``assign_masks``/ ``assign_attrs``, which updates or inserts the given coordinates/masks/attributes to the :class:`scipp.DataArray` `#3110 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3110/>`_.
* Fixed performance issues for ``datetime64`` operations `#3123 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3123/>`_.
* The HDF5 writer and reader now supports builtin types (e.g. ``int``, ``str``) and numpy types (e.g. ``np.ndarray``, ``np.int64``) as data group items `#3124 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3124/>`_.
* :class:`scipp.DataGroup` reduction- and shape operations now handle items of lower dimensionality more consistently.
  Operations will thus work in more situations, rather than raise exceptions `#3136 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3136/>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix bug in :func:`scipp.lookup` raising an exception in arithmetic operations with unrelated coords `#3112 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3112>`_.

* ``scipp.geometry.rotation_matrix_from_quaternion_coeffs`` has been deprecated without replacement `#3094 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3094>`_.

v23.03.0
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added new string-formatting options `#3017 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3017>`_, `#3028 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3028>`_.

* Added :func:`scipp.testing.assert_identical` `#3066 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3066>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Plopp <https://scipp.github.io/plopp/>`_ is now the default plotting backend `#3076 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3076>`_.
* ``open_hdf5`` and ``to_hdf5`` have been renamed to ``load_hdf5`` and ``save_hdf5``, respectively, `#3081 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3081>`_.
* Removed ``scipp.matrix`` and ``scipp.matrices``. Use functions in ``scipp.spatial`` to construct more specialized variables, `#3098 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3098>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix access to value of 0-D variable with "spatial transform" dtypes using the ``value`` property.
  Previously this raised an exception if the dtype was ``affine_transform3``, ``translation3``, or ``rotation3`` `#3033 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3033>`_.
* Fix ``coords.keys()`` and ``coords.items()`` to compare underlying dicts (same for ``masks`` and ``attrs``) `#3064 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3064>`_.

Documentation

v23.01.0
--------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added new data structure :class:`scipp.DataGroup`, a more flexible version of ``Dataset`` that does not enforce alignment and supports nesting.
* Added support for arbitrary unit, degrees Celsius and other special units `#2931 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2931>`_.
* :class:`scipp.Dataset` now supports ``drop_coords``, which returns :class:`scipp.Dataset` without the given coordinate by names  `#2940 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2940>`_.
* :class:`scipp.DataArray` now supports ``drop_coords``/ ``drop_masks``/ ``drop_attrs``, which returns :class:`scipp.DataArray` without the given coordinates/masks/attributes names by names `#2940 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2940>`_.
* Added ``clear``, ``copy`` and ``popitem`` to the ``.coords``, ``.masks``, and ``.attrs`` accessors `#3014 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/3014>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The HDF5 format changed to accommodate more units, old files can still be loaded but new ones cannot be loaded with an old version of Scipp `#2931 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2931>`_.
* Implicit and explicit broadcasting of operands with variances in operations was disabled.
  This introduces correlations that Scipp cannot handle and would therefore silently underestimate uncertainties.
  Instead a :py:class:`scipp.VariancesError` is raised now `#2895 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2895>`_.
* The ``.value`` and ``.variance`` properties now return `numpy scalars <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html>`_ for numeric types.
  This will not affect the majority of use cases but may break some edge cases, in particular ``isinstance`` checks.
  `#2962 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2962>`_

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug in :py:func:`scipp.hist` and :py:func:`scipp.bin`, leading to assignment of records with very large coord values outside the bin boundaries to a bin `#2923 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2923>`_.
* Fix a bug in open end slicing of bins, in case the given right/left end is smaller/bigger than the min/max value of the slicing target, it uses the given end instead of min/max for the open end `#2933 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2933>`_.
* Fix issue with events close to upper or lower bin bounds getting dropped by :func:`scipp.lookup` with edges that form a "linspace" `#2942 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2942>`_.
* Fix minor issue with events close to bin bounds getting assigned to the wrong bin by :func:`scipp.lookup` with edges that form a "linspace" `#2942 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2942>`_.
* Fix two memory usage and performance issue that affected certain cases of :py:func:`scipp.hist` `#2977 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2977>`_.
* Fix bounds check in integer-array indexing, which previously silently skipped out-of-range indices `#2986 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2986>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stability, Maintainability, and Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v22.11.0 (November 2022)
------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added :py:func:`scipp.elemwise_func` for defining custom transformations of input variables based on a Python function compiled via ``numba.cfunc`` `#2886 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2886>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The SciPy wrappers ``integrate``, ``interpolate``, ``ndimage``, ``optimize``, and ``signal`` were moved into the :py:mod:`scipp.scipy` submodule `#2881 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2881>`_.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Scipp is migrating to use `Plopp <https://scipp.github.io/plopp>`_ instead of a built-in plotting solution.
  The latter is now deprecated.
  Scipp v23.03.0 (March 2023) and all later versions will use Plopp by default.
  The built-in plotting solution is deprecated and will be removed (at the earliest) in Scipp v23.08.0 (August 2023) without further warning.

v0.17.0 (October 2022)
----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* :class:`scipp.Bins` now supports ``__getitem__``, providing a shorthand for extracting events based on a coord value or value interval. This is equivalent functionality to label-based indexing for dense data but considers the coordinates of the underlying bin content `#2831 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2831>`_.
* Much faster ``obj.bins.concat`` operations in presence of many bins `#2825 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2825>`_.
* When mapping between many input and output bins:
  Avoid huge memory use and slow performance in use of :py:func:`scipp.bin` and :py:func:`scipp.group` when only entire bins are combined (rather than splitting bins based on bin content coordinates).
  This avoids a number of cases where Python kernel used to crash since Scipp ran out of memory `#2827 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2827>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.sum` now also accepts a sequence of dimension labels `#2827 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2827>`_.
* Added aliases for units to customize string formatting and support user defined units `#2855 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2855>`_.
* Add ``pip`` (PyPI) packages for Python 3.11.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed how units are stored in HDF5 files. Old files can still be loaded but new files cannot be loaded by an old scipp `#2836 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2836>`_.
* Removed support for custom units as implemented by LLNL/Units. They were only usable because of an oversight `#2843 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2843>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix an issue in the setup of automatic bin edges when giving a bin count to :py:func:`scipp.bin`, :py:func:`scipp.hist`, and :py:func:`scipp.rebin`. This lead to a minuscule shift in the resulting edges, which is irrelevant in most cases, but results in events at the lower bin bound to be placed in a correct but lower bin than expected `#2838 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2838>`_.
* Fix runtime configuration not loading a file int he working directory `#2848 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2848>`_.
* Fix bug in py:func:`scipp.compat.from_pandas` with non-string names `#2851 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2851>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``concat`` action of :py:func:`scipp.groupby` is deprecated. Use :py:func:`scipp.group` and :py:func:`scipp.bin` instead `#2827 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2827>`_.

* Fix :func:`scipp.spatial.rotations` to support creation of quaternion arrays with more than 1 dimension `#2822 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2822>`_.

v0.16.2 (August 2022)
---------------------

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix for ``pythreejs-2.4.0``.
* Fix ipython display for ``ipywidgets>=8``

v0.16.0 (August 2022)
---------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* :meth:`scipp.Bins.concat` now supports concatenation of all dims, with ``da.bins.concat()`` `#2726 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2726>`_.
* Added support for calling :func:`scipp.arange` with strings to create datetime ranges `#2729 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2729>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The plots are no longer interactive by default, standard Matplotlib rules now apply (the inline static backend is the default). Use ``%matplotlib widget`` for interactive plots `#2671 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2671>`_.
* The ``copy`` method of groupby has been removed. Use advanced indexing instead `#2676 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2676>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Binary arithmetic operations such as ``x + x`` of ``x * x``, i.e., with both operands the same, now handle correlations correctly and result in the correct variances in the output `#2709 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2709>`_.
* Made ``__sizeof__`` and related functions more accurate `#2705 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2705>`_.
* 1-D entries with identical dimensions but different coordinate units are no longer plotted on the same axes `#2728 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2728>`_.
* Fixed size estimates for slices of binned variables `#2719 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2719>`_.
* ``Coords`` and other dict-like types now raise exceptions when modifying during iteration instead of causing a segfault `#2719 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2719>`_.
* Data arrays with missing coords can now be plotted using the experimental plotting `#2748 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2748>`_.
* Fix a bug in the argument detection when using setitem in combination with value-based slicing `#2750 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2750>`_.
* Fixed broken profile plot on 3-D data `#2746 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2746>`_.
* Fixed broken boolean-indexing and sort operations on arrays that contain binned data `#2759 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2759>`_.
* ``transform_coords`` now works with datasets with only coordinates but no data `#2755 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2755>`_.
* Fixed a bug when using :func:`scipp.hist` on a Dataset that contains binned data `#2764 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2764>`_.
* Fixed the ``rename`` methods to also rename bin coords and attrs of binned data `#2774 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2774>`_.
* Fixed the ``rename_dims`` methods which failed to check for conflicting bin-edge coords of length 2 failing outside the object's dimensions `#2775 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2775>`_.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Advanced indexing is now much faster.
- Sorting is now much faster.

v0.15.0 (July 2022)
-------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added conversion from Scipp objects to Xarray objects (previously only converting from Xarray to Scipp was available) `#2624 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2624>`_.
* Added option for a more compact string format of variables `#2625 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2625>`_.
* Overhauled and streamlined usability of functions related to binning, grouping, and histogramming with additional features such as automatic bin edges and histogramming ignoring NaN values.
  See :func:`scipp.bin`, :func:`scipp.group`, :func:`scipp.hist`, :func:`scipp.nanhist`, and :func:`scipp.rebin` `#2633 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2633>`_.
* Added support for histogramming and binning variables, in addition to existing support for data arrays `#2678 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2678>`_.
* Added keyword argument syntax to :func:`scipp.transform_coords` for more concise user experience in simple single-step transformations `#2670 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2670>`_.
* Generalized :func:`scipp.lookup` to also support non-histogram functions for value lookup, with supported modes "previous" and "nearest".
  Also adding support for custom fill values `#2681 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2681>`_.
* Added possibility to pass keyword arguments to ``rename_dims``, matching the signature of ``rename`` `#2689 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2689>`_.
* Python's builtin conversion to "bool" using ``__bool__`` is now supported for 0-D boolean variables.
  This makes the results of comparison usable with ``assert`` or ``if`` `#2695 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2695>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* :func:`scipp.optimize.curve_fit` now raises ``ValueError`` if the input variance contains a 0 `#2620 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2620>`_.
* Replaced the widget-based :func:`scipp.table` viewer with a simpler pure-HTML table `#2613 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2613>`_.
* :func:`scipp.flatten` now drops mismatching bin edge coordinates instead of raising a ``BinEdgeError`` `#2652 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2652>`_.
* The ``targets`` argument of :func:`scipp.transform_coords` is not position-only `#2670 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2670>`_.
* :func:`scipp.lookup` now uses NaN as fill value for floating-point valued functions (for points out of bounds or masked points).
   Integral-valued functions are unchanged (using 0 as before).
   See also new argument for custom fill values `#2681 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2681>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix bug where coordinates in were dropped by :func:`scipp.transform_coords` with ``keep_*=False`` even through they were specified as ``targets`` `#2642 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2642>`_.
* Fix segmentation fault in :func:`scipp.bin` when binning in 2 or more dimensions with certain coordinate values `#2644 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2644>`_.
* Fix issue with events close to upper or lower bin bounds getting dropped by :func:`scipp.bin` and :func:`scipp.histogram` when binning with edges that form a "linspace" `#2644 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2644>`_.
* Fix minor issue with events close to bin bounds getting assigned to the wrong bin by :func:`scipp.bin` and :func:`scipp.histogram` when binning with edges that form a "linspace" `#2644 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2644>`_.
* Fix issues with copying binned structured data or fields of binned structured data `#2650 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2650>`_.
* Fix various missing dimension and/or shape checks when slicing with a condition variable `#2657 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2657>`_.
* Fix serious bug in :func:`scipp.bin` that was introduced in scipp-0.12.0. This corrupts data when binning into more than 65536 at a time `#2680 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2680>`_.
* Fix issue in :func:`scipp.lookup`, which led to ignored masks in case of integral function values with non-linspace coordinates `#2681 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2681>`_.
* Fix reduction operations of 0-D binned data, which previously returned the input unchanged `#2685 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2685>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove two ancient tutorials.

Deprecations

* The ``histogram`` function is deprecated. The new :py:func:`scipp.hist` can replace it in most cases, otherwise :py:func:`scipp.binning.make_histogrammed` provides the old functionality `#2633 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2633>`_.
* The ``bins``, ``edges``, and ``erase`` keyword arguments of :py:func:`scipp.bin` are deprecated. :py:func:`scipp.bin` and :py:func:`scipp.group` can replace it in most cases, otherwise :py:func:`scipp.binning.make_binned` provides the old functionality `#2633 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2633>`_.

* Support ``dtype=vector3`` in :func:`scipp.isinf` and :func:`scipp.isfinite` `#2593 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2593>`_.
* Added support for passing any dict-like objects or iterables of tuples as ``coords``, ``attrs``, and ``masks`` arguments to initializers of :class:`scipp.DataArray` and :class:`scipp.Dataset` `#2603 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2603>`_.
* Added support for passing any dict-like objects or iterables of tuples as the ``data`` argument to the initializer of :class:`scipp.Dataset` `#2603 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2603>`_.
* Added support for ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` in more reduction operations (e.g. :func:`scipp.max`) `#2600 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2600>`_.
* Added support for masks in reductions of binned data `#2608 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2608>`_.

* Reduce effect of rounding errors when converting units `#2607 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2607>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed :meth:`scipp.Variable.dims` and :meth:`scipp.Variable.shape` and corresponding properties in ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` to return tuples `2543 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2543>`_.
* :func:`scipp.scalar` and :func:`scipp.index` now require keyword arguments for all but the ``value`` argument and :func:`scipp.vector` can take ``value`` positionally `2585 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2585>`_.
* Removed ``out`` argument from reduction operations (e.g. :func:`scipp.sum`) `2591 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2591>`_.
* :func:`scipp.datetime` and :func:`scipp.datetimes` now raise an error if a datetime string with timezone information is provided.
  Previously this was a ``DeprecationWarning`` from NumPy `2604 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2604>`_.
* Replaced the widget-based :func:`scipp.table` viewer with a simpler pure-HTML table `#2613 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2613>`_.

* :func:`scipp.to_unit` avoids a rounding problem when converting datetimes. This previously led to errors, e.g., of about 300 nanoseconds when converting a current (2020s) datetime64 from seconds to nanoseconds `#2533 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2533>`_.
* Fix handling of keyword arguments in :func:`scipp.optimize.curve_fit`. They were previously checked for conflicts but otherwise ignored `#2545 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2545>`_.
* Fix a segmentation fault in :func:`scipp.bin` when grouping by a variable with 0 elements `#2590 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2590>`_.
* Fix :func:`scipp.nanmean` for ``dtype=vector3``.
  Previously this did not ignore NaN elements as it should.
  :func:`scipp.isnan` is affected by the same fix.
  Previously it always returned ``False`` for ``dtype=vector3`` `#2593 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2593>`_.

v0.12.0 (February 2022)
-----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added support for :py:func:`abs` to :py:class:`scipp.DataArray`, :py:class:`scipp.Dataset`, :py:class:`scipp.Variable` `#2382 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2382>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.bin` will now also look at attributes to perform the binning, instead of only looking at the coordinates `#2388 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2388>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.squeeze` to remove length-1 dimensions `#2385 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2385>`_.
* Switched to new system for runtime configuration, see the corresponding section in the reference documentation `#2389 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2389>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.midpoints` which can be used to compute bin-centers `#2404 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2404>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.fold` now supports ``-1`` for one of the dimension sizes, to indicate automatic shape `#2414 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2414>`_.
* Added ``quiet`` argument to :py:func:`scipp.transform_coords` `#2420 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2420>`_.
* Added support for strides for positional slicing. Negative strides are not supported for now `#2423 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2423>`_.

* Added the ``.rename`` method to :py:class:`scipp.Variable`, :py:class:`scipp.DataArray`, and :py:class:`scipp.Dataset` that renames both dimensions and coords/attrs at the same time `#2428 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2428>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The configuration option ``config['plot']['padding']`` is now called ``config['plot']['bounding_box']``, no action is required if it was never modified `#2389 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2389>`_.
* :py:func:`scipp.rebin` now applies masks that depend on the rebinning dimension to avoid "growing" effect on masks which previously resulted in masking more than intended `#2383 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2383>`_.
* The ``unit`` attribute now distinguishes ``None`` from ``dimensionless`` `#2395 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2395>`_ and `#2417 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2417>`_.

  * For number-like dtypes the default is ``dimensionless`` (unchanged) whereas all other dtypes such as strings default to ``None`` (new).
  * ``bool`` (used for masks) is not considered number-like and the default unit is ``None``.
  * Comparison operator results now use ``None`` as unit of their output.
  * When integers without unit are used as indices, the new :py:func:`scipp.index` can be used to create a scalar variable without unit.

* :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotations_from_rotvecs` has been changed to taking a variable input rather than separate values/dims/units.
* ``scipp.NotFoundError`` error has been replaced with ``KeyError`` in Python `#2416 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2416>`_.
* Some functions now raise ``scipp.DimensionError`` instead of ``scipp.NotFoundError`` `#2416 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2416>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix :py:func:`scipp.full`, which previously converted or attempted to convert all values to ``float64`` unless the ``dtype`` was specified explicitly `#2395 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2395>`_.
* Fix :py:func:`scipp.transform_coords` for sliced binned data, used to raise an exception `#2406 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2406>`_.
* Fix 1d plots y-axis limits when toggling log-scale with buttons and fix 2d plot colorbar when Inf values `#2426 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2426>`_.
* Fix bug leading to datasets dims/shape modification after failed item insertion `#2437 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2437>`_.
* Fix a plotting bug when 2d data has y coord associated with dimension x `#2446 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2446>`_.
* Fix plotting with custom tick labels of ``dtype=datetime64`` which previously raised an exception `#2449 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2449>`_.

v0.11.0 (January 2022)
----------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Added new datatypes for representing spatial transformations: ``affine_transform3``, ``rotation3``, and ``translation3``. Each of these can be combined and applied to the existing vector datatype.
* Added support for slicing without specifying a dimension (only for 1-D objects) `#2321 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2321>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.interpolate.interp1d` as convenience wrapper of the scipy functions of the same name `#2324 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2324>`_.
* Added :py:func:`scipp.integrate.trapezoid` and :py:func:`scipp.integrate.simpson` as convenience wrappers of the scipy functions of the same name `#2324 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2324>`_.
* Added ``unit`` property to ``obj.bins`` for getting and setting unit of bin elements `#2330 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2330>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor change in behavior of dimension renaming in ``transform_coords``, new behavior documented in `Coordinate transformations <../user-guide/coordinate-transformations.rst>`_. Most use cases are unaffected. `#2319 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2319>`_.
* ``sc.spatial.transform.as_rotvec`` has been moved to :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotation_as_rotvec`
* ``sc.spatial.transform.from_rotvec`` has been moved to :py:func:`scipp.spatial.rotations_from_rotvecs`, and now returns a rotation data type rather than a matrix.
  For consistency with other transformation creation functions, ``rotations_from_rotvecs`` now takes ``values``, ``dims``, and ``unit`` separately.
* The matrix dtype ``matrix_3_float64`` has been renamed to ``linear_transform3``, and should now be constructed with :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transform`.
* The vector dtype ``vector_3_float64`` has been renamed to ``vector3``.
* Scipp's logger is no longer preconfigured, this has to be done by the user `#2372 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2372>`_.
* Data types are now attributes of the :py:class:`scipp.DType` class and the ``scipp.dtype`` module has been removed `#2373 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2373>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix coordinate and attribute comparisons to treat NaN (not-a-number) values as equal, which previously prevented most operations with data arrays or datasets that contained NaN values in their coordinates or attributes `#2331 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2331>`_.
* Fix incorrect result from ``sc.bin`` when rebinning an inner dimension to a multi-dimensional coordinate `#2355 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2355>`_.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``sc.matrix`` and ``sc.matrices`` have been deprecated in favour of :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transform` and :py:func:`scipp.spatial.linear_transforms`, and will be removed in a future release of Scipp.
* The previously deprecated ``concatenate`` and ``groupby(..).concatenate`` have been removed. Use :py:func:`scipp.concat` and :py:func:`scipp.GroupByDataArray.concat` instead.

* Added ``bins_like`` for broadcasting dense variables to binned variables, e.g., for converting bin coordinates into event coordinates `#2225 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2225>`_.
* ``groupby`` now also supports grouping by attributes instead of just by coordinates `#2227 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2227>`_.
* Added ``concat`` to replace ``concatenate``. In contrast to the now deprecated ``concatenate``, ``concat`` supports concatenation of lists of objects instead of just two objects `#2232 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2232>`_.

* Changed names of arithmetic functions to match NumPy's names: ``plus`` |rarr| :func:`scipp.add`, ``minus`` |rarr| :func:`scipp.subtract`, ``times`` |rarr| :func:`scipp.multiply` `#1999 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/1999>`_.
* Changed Variable init method, all arguments are keyword-only, special overloads which default-initialize data were removed `#1994 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/1994>`_.
* The ``axes`` keyword arg of ``plot`` has been removed.
  Use ``labels`` to define labels and ``transpose`` to transpose instead `#2018 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2018>`_.
* The ``redraw`` method of plots does not support replacing data variables of data arrays any more, but only updates of data values `#2018 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2018>`_.
* Made most arguments of ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` constructors keyword-only `#2008 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2008>`_.
* Made arguments of many functions keyword-only, e.g. constructors of ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset``, ``bin``, and ``atan2`` `#1983 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/1983>`_, `#2008 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2008>`_, `#2012 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2012>`_.
* ``astype`` and ``to_unit`` now copy the input by default even when no transformation is required, use the new ``copy`` argument to avoid `#2016 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2016>`_.
* ``rename_dims`` does not rename dimension-coords any more, only dims will be renamed `#2058 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2058>`_.
* ``rename_dims`` does not modify the input anymore but returns a new object with renamed dims `#2058 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2058>`_.
* ``issorted`` and ``islinspace`` return a variable of type boolean instead of a boolean `#2094 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2094>`_.
* Multi-dimensional coordinates are no longer associated with their inner dimension, which affects the behavior when slicing:
  Such coords will no longer be turned into attributes during a slice operation on the inner dimension `#2098 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2098>`_.
* ``buckets.map(histogram, da.data, 'time')`` has been replaced by ``lookup(histogram, 'time')[da.bins.coords['time']]`` `#2112 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2112>`_.
* ``rebin`` and ``histogram`` now support any unit. ``plot()`` guesses which resampling mode to use and provides a button to toggle this `#2180 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2180>`_.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Various fixes in ``plot``, see  `#2018 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2018>`_ for details.
* Operations with Python floats to long interpret the float as 32-bit float `#2101 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2101>`_.
* Multi-dimensional bin-edge coordinates may now be edges for a non-inner dimension `#2098 <https://github.com/scipp/scipp/pull/2098>`_.

v0.5.0 (January 2021)
---------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New ``profile`` plotting functionality where one of the slider dimensions can be displayed as a profile in a subplot (1-D and 2-D projections only).
* Sliders have a thickness slider associated with them and can be used to show slices of arbitrary thickness.
* Can hide/show individual masks on plots.
* Can toggle log scale of axes and colorbar with buttons in figure toolbar.
* Add binned data support, replacing "event list" dtypes as well as "realign" support.
* Plotting of event data (binned data) with dynamic resampling with "infinite zoom" functionality.
* Value-based slicing support.
* Possibility to plot Scipp objects using ``my_data_array.plot()`` in addition to the classical ``plot()`` free function.
* Support for saving and loading Scipp data structures to HDF5.
* More functions such as ``nanmean`` for better handling of special values such as ``INF`` and ``NaN``.
* TBB (multi-threading) support for MacOS.
* ``scipp.neutron``

  * Improved instrument view, e.g., with buttons to align camera with an axis.
  * Experiment logs (previously using Mantid's ``Run``) are now represented as native Scipp objects, e.g., as scalar attributes holding a data array representing a time-series such as a temperature log.
  * Support conversion of ``mantid.MaskWorkspace``.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``Dataset`` does not have a ``masks`` property any more.
  Use ``ds['item'].masks`` instead.
* ``Dataset`` does not support attributes any more.
* ``DataArray`` and dataset item attributes are now are now handled as "unaligned" coords.
  Use ``ds['item'].coords`` or ``array.attrs`` to access these.
* API for log scale on axes and colors has changed.
  Use ``plot(da, scale={'tof': 'log'})`` to set a log scale on a coordinate axis, and use ``plot(da, norm='log')`` to have a log image colorscale or a log y axis on a 1d plot.
* ``vmin`` and ``vmax`` now represent absolute values instead of exponents when ``norm='log'``.
* The ``ipympl`` matplotlib backend is now required for using inside Jupyter notebooks.
  This has been added as a dependency.
  It is also the only interactive backend that works in JupyterLab.
* Removed support for ``event_list`` ``dtype``, use binned data instead.
* Removed support for "realigned" data. This is replaced by the more flexible and generic support for "binned" data.

v0.4 (July 2020)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* New realign functionality.
* Support for event-filtering.
* Support for subtraction and addition for (realigned) event data.
* Non-range slicing changed to preserve coords as attrs rather than dropping
* ``scipp.neutron``: Instrument view with advanced geometry support, showing correct pixel shapes.
* Instrument view working on doc pages.
* Made it simpler to add new ``dtype`` and support ``transform`` for all types.
* Comparison functions such as ``less``, ``greater_equal``, ...
* ``all`` and ``any`` can work over all dimensions as well as explicitly provided dimension argument
* It is now possible to convert between Scipp objects and Python dictionaries using ``to_dict`` and ``from_dict``.
* New functions ``collapse`` and ``slices`` can be use to split one or more dimensions of a DataArray to a dict of DataArrays.
* You can now inspect the global object list of via the ``repr`` for Scipp showing Datasets, DataArrays and Variables
* Internal cleanup and documentation additions.

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Several fixes in the plotting (non-regular bins, colorbar limits, axes tick labels from unaligned coordinates, etc...)

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Coord and attributes names for neutron data have been standardized, now using hyphens instead of underscore, except for subscripts. Affected examples: ``pulse-time`` (previously ``pulse_times``), ``source-position`` (previously ``source_position``), ``sample-position`` (previously ``sample_position``), ``detector-info`` (previously ``detector_info``).
* ``scipp.neutron.load`` must use ``advanced_geometry=True`` option for loading ``detector-info`` and pixel shapes.
* Normalization of event data cannot be done directly any more, must use ``realign``.
* Plotting variances in 2D has been removed, and the API for using ``matplotlib`` axes has been simplified slightly, since we no longer have axes for variances:

  * Before: ``plot(..., mpl_axes={"ax": myax0, "cax": myax1})``
  * After: ``plot(..., ax=myax0, cax=myax1)``
* Plot with keyword argument ``collapse`` has been removed in favor of two more generic free functions that return a ``dict`` of data arrays that can then directly be passed to the ``plot`` function:

  * ``collapse(d, keep='x')`` slices all dimensions away to keep only ``'x'``, thus always returning 1D slices.
  * ``slices(d, dim='x')`` slices along dimension ``'x'``, returning slices with ``ndim-1`` dimensions contaiing all dimensions other than ``'x'``.

-----------------

* Many bug fixes and small additions
* Multi-threading with TBB for many operations.
* Performance improvements in hotspots
* Remove ``Dim`` labels in favor of plain strings. Connected to this, the ``labels`` property for data arrays and datasets has been removed. Use ``coords`` instead.

v0.2 (December 2019)
--------------------

* Support for masks stored in ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset``.

* Support for ``groupby``, implementing a split-apply-combine approach as known from pandas.

* Enhanced support for event data:

  * Histogramming with "weighted" data.
  * Multiplication/division operators between event data and histogram.

* Enhanced plotting support:

  * Now focussing on ``matplotlib``.
  * Multi-dimensional plots with interactive sliders, and much more.

* Significant performance improvements for majority of operations. Typically performance is now in the same ballpark as what the memory bandwidth on a single CPU core can support.

* Fancy ``_repr_html_`` for quick views of datasets in Jupyter notebooks.

* Conda packages now also available for Windows.

* ``scipp.neutron`` gets improved converters from Mantid, supporting neutron monitors, sample information, and run information stored as attributes.

This is the first official release of ``scipp``.
It is not yet meant for production-use, but marks a big step for us in terms of usability and features.
The API may change without notice in future releases.

Features:

* All key data structures (``Variable``, ``DataArray``, and ``Dataset``).
* Slicing.
* Basic arithmetic operations.
* Physical units.
* Propagation of uncertainties.
* Event data.

Limitations:

* Limited performance and no parallelization.
* Numerous "edge cases" not supported yet.
* While tested, probably far from bug-free.
