Karaoke Lyrics Processor is a tool to prepare song lyrics for karaoke video production. 

It processes lyrics by splitting long lines, handling parentheses, and ensuring that each line fits within a specified maximum length. 
This tool is especially useful for creating karaoke tracks where timing and line length are crucial for readability.

## Features

- **Line Splitting**: Automatically splits long lines of lyrics to ensure they fit within a specified maximum length, making them more readable and suitable for karaoke display.
- **Intelligent Splitting**: Finds the best split points in lines, considering punctuation and logical breaks in the lyrics.
- **Parentheses Handling**: Processes lines containing parentheses appropriately, ensuring that the lyrical flow is maintained.
- **Clipboard Support**: Copies the processed lyrics to the clipboard for easy pasting into video production software or other applications.
- **Debug Mode**: Offers a debug mode for detailed logging, helping with troubleshooting and fine-tuning the processing.
