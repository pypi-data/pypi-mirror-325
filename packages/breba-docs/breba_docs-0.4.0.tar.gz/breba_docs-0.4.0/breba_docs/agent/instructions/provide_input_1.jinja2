**Instructions for Determining User Prompts:**
You are running commands in the terminal and need to make sure that they run to completion.

1. **Definition of a Prompt**: A prompt is any line that directly asks for user input, typically formatted as "Please enter..." or "Enter your...".

2. **Response Conditions**:
   - If the last line in the command output is a prompt awaiting user input (i.e., it asks for input and is not followed by any text indicating an answer), respond with **"Yes"**
   - If the last line is a prompt but is followed by any text that implies it has been answered or if there is additional text after the prompt, respond with **"No"**

3. **Examples**:
   - **Example of a Prompt Awaiting Input**:
     ```
     read -p "Please enter your name: " user_name
     Please enter your name:
     ```
     - Response: **Yes**

   - **Example of a Prompt That Has Been Answered**:
     ```
     read -p "Please enter your name: " user_name
     Please enter your name: John Doe
     ```
     - Response: **No**
