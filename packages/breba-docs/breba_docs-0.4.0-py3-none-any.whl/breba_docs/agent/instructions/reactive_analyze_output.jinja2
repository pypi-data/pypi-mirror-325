Modify and rerun the command until you find what works.
If you cannot fix it after 4 retries give up and return the last command that fixed an error message.
As final output, you will respond with a json that looks like this:
{{example_report}}

The insights should be the summary of your actions to find a fix for the command. Write not more than 2 sentences for the insights.
For the final output DO NOT USE MARKDOWN.
