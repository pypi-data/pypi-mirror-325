`datamop` is a data cleaning and wrangling python package designed to streamline the preprocessing of datasets. Whether you meet missing values, inconsistent categorical columns or need scaling for numeric columns when dealing with data. `datamop` provides a simple and consistent solution to automate and simplify these repetitive tasks. 

## Documentation

The full documentation including package tutorial and API reference can be found on the ReadTheDocs [here](https://datamop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Functions

The following are core functions of this package:

* `sweep_nulls()`: Handles missing values such as imputation or removal, based on user preference.

* `column_encoder()`: Encodes categorical columns using either one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding, based on user preference.

* `column_scaler()`: Scales numerical columns, including Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization, based on user preference.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install datamop
```

## Usage

All functions in `datamop` take a pandas DataFrame as input. Each function returns a modified pandas DataFrame as output, with the specified transformations applied.
For a quick glimpse into what `datamop` can do, here are a few simple examples:

`datamop` can be used to encode columns in a DataFrame using one-hot or ordinal encoding as follows:

```
import pandas as pd
import datamop

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Sport': ['Tennis', 'Basketball', 'Football', 'Badminton'],
    'Level': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
})

encoded_df_onehot = datamop.column_encoder(df, columns=['Sport'], method='one-hot')
encoded_df_ordinal = datamop.column_encoder(df, columns=['Level'], method='ordinal', order={'Level': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']})

```

This package can also be used to handle missing values such as imputation or removal, based on user preference as following:

```
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a': [10, np.nan, 30],
    'b': [1.5, 2.5, np.nan],
    'c': ['x', np.nan, 'z']
    })
cleaned = datamop.sweep_nulls(df, strategy='mean')
```

Additionally, this package can be used to scale numerical columns as following:

```
df = pd.DataFrame({"price": [25, 50, 75]})
df_scaled = datamop.column_scaler(df, column = 'price', method='minmax', new_min=0, new_max=1)
```

## Python Ecosystem

`datamop` fits into Python data preprocessing ecosystem by offering a more lightweight and user-friendly alternative to complex libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`. `datamop` focuses specifically on handling missing values, encoding categorical columns and normalizing numerical columns. `datamop` changes `scikit-learn` tasks performed by modules like `SimpleImputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `OrdinalEncoder` and `StandardScaler` with fewer steps and easier customization.
Similar functionality can be found in:

* **pandas** (Functions like `fillna()` for handling missing values, `get_dummies()` for one-hot encoding, and `replace()` for categorical encoding): [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

* **scikit-learn** (Modules like `SimpleImputer` for missing value imputation, `OneHotEncoder` for one-hot encoding, `OrdinalEncoder` for ordinal encoding, and `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` for scaling numerical data.): [scikit-learn preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
