    """Compute the phase transition matrix for knapsack instances.

    In computational problems, a phase transition refers to a phenomenon where
    the probability of finding a solution changes abruptly as some parameter
    crosses a critical threshold. This concept draws inspiration from physics,
    where phase transitions (e.g., water freezing) occur at critical
    thresholds. Such transitions have also been shown to arise in NP-complete
    problems, where the  likelihood of finding a solution changes
    abruptly as a key parameter crosses a critical value.

    For the knapsack problem, this phase transition manifests in terms of
    the relationship between the normalised capacity (`c`) and normalised
    profit (`p`) of an instance. The phase transition has been shown to occur
    when the ratio `r = c / p` is near 1. Instances with 0 < r < 1 are less
    expensive to solve as compred to instances with r ≈ 1.

    This function provide an implementation of the phase transition
    of the knapsack problem, based on Yadav, Nitin, et al. (2018).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_items : int
        Number of items in each generated knapsack instance.
    samples : int, optional
        Number of instances to evaluate in each cell of the grid. Default is
        100.
    outcome : str, optional
        The outcome to measure in each cell. One or of "solvability" "time"
        or "both". If "solvability" is specified, the phase transition matrix
        represents the proprotion of instances that are satisfiable in each
        cell. If "time" is specified, the phase transition matrix represents
        the average time taken to solve instances in each cell. If "both" is
        specified, the returned phase transition is a tuple with the
        the solvability matrix as the first element, and the time matrix as the
        second element. Default is "both".

    Returns
    -------
        coordinate_matrices : tuple of np.ndarray
            The coordinate matrices for normalised capacities and normalised
            profits. The first matrix corresponds to normalised capacities,
            and the second to normalised profits.
        phase_transition : np.ndarray
            If ``outcome="solvability"``, a 2D matrix where each cell
            represents the proportion of instances that are satisfiable. If
            ``outcome="time"``, a 2D matrix where each cell represents the
            average time taken to solve instances. If ``outcome="both``, a
            tuple containing both matrices.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    solver : str, optional
        Which solver to use for evaluating each instance. Default is
        "branch_and_bound".
    minizinc_solver: str, optional
        If ``solver="minizinc"``, this argument specifies which minizinc solver
        to use. Default is "coinbc".
    resolution: tuple[int, int], optional
        Resolution of the normalised capacity-normalised profit grid.
        The first element corresponds to the resolution of normalised
        profit, and the second to the resolution of normalised capacity.
        Defaults to (41, 41).
    weight_dist : str, optional
        Name of the distribution to sample item weights from. Defaults to
        uniform distribution over the half-open interval [0.001, 1).
    weight_dist_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the weight distribution
        function. Defaults to None.
    value_dist : str, optional
        Name of the distribution to sample item values from. Defaults to
        uniform distribution over the half-open interval [0.001, 1).
    value_dist_kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the value distribution
        function. Defaults to None.
    seed : int | None, optional
        Seed for sampling. Defaults to None.
    path str, optional:
        Path to save the phase transition to. Defaults
        to None.

    Notes
    -----
    The phase transition is typically applied with reference to the decision
    variant of the knapsack problem. To apply the phase transition to the
    optimisation variant, the target profit should be set to the optimal
    solution value of the instance. One can then compute the normalised
    profit based on the optimal solution, and observe where the instance
    lies in the phase transition matrix.
