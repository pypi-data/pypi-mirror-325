def sahni_k(
    arrangement: Arrangement,
    capacity: int,
) -> int:
    """Compute the Sahni-k metric for a given knapsack arrangement.

    The Sahni-k metric [1]_ [2]_ is defined as the smallest number of items
    (k) whose inclusion in the solution is necessary for the greedy algorithm
    (applied to the remaining items) to yield an optimal solution.

    If `k` equals zero, the Sahni-k algorithm coincides with the greedy
    algorithm. If k is equal to the number of items in the solution, the
    algorithm is similar to a brute-force search through the entire search
    space.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arrangement : Arrangement
        A knapsack arrangement (subset of items) for which to compute Sahni-k.
    capacity : int
        The capacity constraint of the knapsack.

    Returns
    -------
        int: Sahni-k value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pykp.knapsack import Arrangement
    >>> from pykp.knapsack import Item
    >>> from pykp import metrics
    >>>
    >>> items = [Item(10, 5), Item(20, 8), Item(15, 7)]
    >>> arr = Arrangement(items=items, state=[1, 0, 1])
    >>> metrics.sahni_k(arr, capacity=15)
