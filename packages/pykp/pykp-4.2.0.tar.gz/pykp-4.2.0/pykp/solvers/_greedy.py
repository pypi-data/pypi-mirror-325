def greedy(items: list[Item], capacity: int) -> Solution:
    """Appy the greedy algorithm to a knapsack problem instance.

    The greedy algorithm selects the best item at each step based on the
    value-to-weight ratio, until no more items can be added to the knapsack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    items : np.ndarray[Item]
        Array of items to consider for the knapsack.
    capacity : int
        Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.

    Returns
    -------
    Solution : Solution
        The greedy arrangement of items in the knapsack.

    Examples
    --------
    Solve a knapsack problem using the greedy algorithm:

    >>> from pykp.knapsack import Item
    >>> from pykp import solvers
    >>> items = np.array(
    ...     [
    ...         Item(value=100, weight=50),
    ...         Item(value=200, weight=100),
    ...         Item(value=400, weight=300),
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> capacity = 300
    >>> solvers.greedy(items, capacity)
    (v: 300, w: 150, s: 6)

    .. note::
        The greedy algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution
        to the knapsack problem. It is a heuristic algorithm that selects
        the best item at each step based on the value-to-weight ratio,
        until no more items can be added to the knapsack.
