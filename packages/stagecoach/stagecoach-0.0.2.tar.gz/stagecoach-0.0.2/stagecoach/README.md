# Stagecoach

Stagecoach is a pipeline framework for running stages. It allows you to define and run complex data processing pipelines. Each stage in the pipeline can be configured independently, and the framework handles the execution and dependency management.

## Features

- **Modular Stages**: Define each stage of your pipeline as a separate module.
- **Configuration Management**: Use YAML configuration files to define the pipeline and its stages.
- **Dependency Injection**: Easily inject dependencies into your stages.

## Installation

You can install Stagecoach using `pip`:

```bash
pip install stagecoach
