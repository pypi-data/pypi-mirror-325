Select a connected component from a [membrain-seg](https://github.com/teamtomo/membrain-seg) segmentation.

## Usage

1. Run `membrain-seg` with the `--store-connected-components` flag (optional, otherwise connected components will be calculated while opening)
2. Open the segmentation in Napari, find out which component numbers correspond to your feature.

3. Enter these numbers and a feature name in the widget, press run. 
    ![Widget](images/image3.png)
4. Save the resulting layer using naparis built-in dialog. 
5. Now you have a standalone binary segmentation of your feature of interest.
