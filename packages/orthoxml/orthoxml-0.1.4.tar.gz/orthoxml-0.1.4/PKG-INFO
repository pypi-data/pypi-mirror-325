Tools for working with OrthoXML files.

## What is OrthoXML Format?
> OrthoXML is a standard for sharing and exchaning orthology predictions. OrthoXML is designed broadly to allow the storage and comparison of orthology data from any ortholog database. It establishes a structure for describing orthology relationships while still allowing flexibility for database-specific information to be encapsulated in the same format.
