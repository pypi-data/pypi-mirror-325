Requirements
============

Batoid is known to work on MacOS and linux, using Python version 3.9+, and
either the clang or gcc compiler with support for c++14.

Installation
============

PyPI
----

Released versions of batoid are available on pypi as both wheels and source
distributions.  To compile from source, you will need a c++14 compiler available and
placed such that that setup.py can find it.  This should hopefully be the case on most
*nix systems, in which case, the following ought to work::

    pip install batoid

Github
------

If PyPI doesn't work, then you can try cloning the source from github and
running setup.py.  Clone the repo with either ::

    git clone git@github.com:jmeyers314/batoid.git

or ::

    git clone https://github.com/jmeyers314/batoid.git

Once the repo has been cloned, then compile and install with ::

    pip install .

Tests
=====

To run the unit tests, from the batoid directory, first install the testing
requirements ::

    pip install -r test_requirements.txt

And then run the tests using pytest ::

    pytest
