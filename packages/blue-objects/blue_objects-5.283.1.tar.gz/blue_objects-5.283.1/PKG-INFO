# 🌀 blue-objects

🌀 `blue-objects` are the inputs and outputs of [AI algo](https://github.com/kamangir/giza). They are maintained in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and their metadata is tracked by [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

For example, the Sentinel-2 [datacube](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-geo/tree/main/blue_geo/datacube) `datacube-EarthSearch-sentinel_2_l1c-S2A_10UDC_20240731_0_L1C` and 🌐 [`@geo watch` outputs](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-geo/tree/main/blue_geo/watch) are `blue-objects`.

```bash
pip install blue-objects
```
