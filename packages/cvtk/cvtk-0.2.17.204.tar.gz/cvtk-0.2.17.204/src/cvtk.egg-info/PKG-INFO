# cvtk


The cvtk (Computer Vision Toolkit) package provides a suite of command-line tools
for common computer vision tasks,
such as image processing, object detection, and image classification.
Built on top of widely-used libraries like PyTorch and MMDetection,
cvtk offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface for tackling complex tasks.
This simplicity makes it ideal for beginners in both computer vision and Python,
allowing them to quickly initiate and advance their projects in the field.
