# Webpage2PDF

A CLI tool to check URLs and save webpages as PDFs.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Installation from PyPI

```bash
pip install webpage-to-pdf-converter
```

## Usage

```bash
webpage-to-pdf https://example.com --save-pdf
```

## Docker

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t url-checker .
```

### Running with Docker

1. Create a local output directory:
```bash
mkdir -p output
```

2. Run the container with volume mount:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output url-checker https://example.com --save-pdf --output /app/output/webpage.pdf
```

The PDF file will be saved in your local `output` directory. The tool will show both the container path and the absolute path of the generated file:

```
âœ“ PDF saved successfully as '/app/output/webpage.pdf'
File location: /app/output/webpage.pdf
```

## Using the Program with Docker

After building the image, you can run the container to check a URL directly. For example, to check "https://example.com" and save the webpage as a PDF, run:
```bash
docker run --rm url-checker https://example.com --save-pdf
```
