# The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem

The **Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC)** problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and graph theory. It involves finding the smallest set of vertices in a graph that **covers** all edges, meaning at least one endpoint of every edge is included in the set.

## Formal Definition

Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, a **vertex cover** is a subset $V' \subseteq V$ such that for every edge $(u, v) \in E$, at least one of $u$ or $v$ belongs to $V'$. The MVC problem seeks the vertex cover with the smallest cardinality.

## Importance and Applications

- **Theoretical Significance:** MVC is a well-known NP-hard problem, central to complexity theory.
- **Practical Applications:**
  - **Network Security:** Identifying critical nodes to disrupt connections.
  - **Bioinformatics:** Analyzing gene regulatory networks.
  - **Wireless Sensor Networks:** Optimizing sensor coverage.

## Related Problems

- **Maximum Independent Set:** The complement of a vertex cover.
- **Set Cover Problem:** A generalization of MVC.

## Problem Statement

Input: A Boolean Adjacency Matrix $M$.

Answer: Find a Minimum Vertex Cover.

### Example Instance: 5 x 5 matrix

|        | c0  | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **r0** | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| **r1** | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| **r2** | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| **r3** | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| **r4** | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |

A matrix is represented in a text file using the following string representation:

```
00101
00010
10001
01000
10100
```

This represents a 5x5 matrix where each line corresponds to a row, and '1' indicates a connection or presence of an element, while '0' indicates its absence.

_Example Solution:_

Vertex Cover Found `0, 1, 4`: Nodes `0, 1, 4` form an optimal solution.

# Our Algorithm - Polynomial Runtime

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Input Validation:**

   - Checks if the input is a valid SciPy sparse matrix.
   - Ensures the matrix is square (representing an adjacency matrix).

2. **Empty Graph Handling:**

   - Returns `None` if the input graph is empty (no vertices or edges).

3. **Graph Conversion:**

   - Converts the sparse adjacency matrix to a NetworkX graph for easier manipulation.

4. **Edge Graph Construction:**

   - Creates a new graph called the "edge graph."
   - Each _node_ in the edge graph represents an _edge_ in the original graph.
   - An _edge_ is added between two nodes in the edge graph if the corresponding edges in the original graph share a vertex.

5. **Minimum Edge Cover:**

   - Computes a minimum edge cover of the edge graph using `nx.min_edge_cover()`. This function typically uses matching techniques.

6. **Vertex Cover from Edge Cover:**

   - Iterates through the edges in the minimum edge cover of the edge graph.
   - For each edge in the edge cover, identifies the corresponding edges in the original graph (using the computed mapping).
   - Finds the common vertex between these two original edges.
   - Adds this common vertex to the vertex cover.

7. **Isolated Edge Handling (Heuristic):**

   - Iterates through the edges in the original graph.
   - If an edge has _both_ endpoints _not_ in the current vertex cover, adds one of the endpoints to the vertex cover. This is intended to handle edges that might not have been covered by the edge cover step.

8. **Redundancy Removal (Heuristic):**
   - Iterates through the vertices in the approximate vertex cover.
   - For each vertex, checks if removing it still results in a valid vertex cover (using `utils.is_vertex_cover()`).
   - If removing the vertex results in a valid cover, the vertex is removed. This step attempts to reduce the size of the cover.

## Runtime Analysis

- **Edge Graph Construction:** $O(|E|^2)$ in the worst case.
- **Minimum Edge Cover:** The complexity of `nx.min_edge_cover()` depends on the underlying algorithm used, but it's typically polynomial (e.g., $O(|V|^3)$ if based on matching). Here, $|V|$ refers to the number of nodes in the _edge graph_, which is equal to the number of edges in the original graph ($|E|$). So, this step is likely $O(|E|^3)$.
- **Vertex Cover Construction (from Edge Cover):** $O(|E|)$, as it iterates through the edges in the edge cover.
- **Isolated Edge Handling:** $O(|E|)$.
- **Redundancy Removal:** $O(|V||E|)$.

**Overall Runtime:** The dominant factor is likely the minimum edge cover calculation on the edge graph, making the overall runtime likely $O(|E|^3)$. However, the $O(|E|^2)$ from the edge graph construction is also significant.

**Important Note:** The runtime analysis is based on the number of edges in the original graph ($|E|$) because the edge graph's size is proportional to $|E|$.
