L1 mosaic index header keys are now correctly populated based on an absolute orientation determined from the CRPIX[12] WCS values.
In the past these header keys were straight copies of the DLNIRSP spatial step X/Y header keys, but this is wrong for a few reasons.
First, the spatial step keys describe *relative* mosaic positions that need knowledge of the spatial step pattern to convert to an absolute orientation.
The spatial step pattern is not encoded into L0 headers and would thus require out-of-channel communications to convert to an absolute orientation (bad).
Second, in some cases the CRPIX values are swapped (see `#54 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/54>`__) and
in these cases the "spatial X" direction will not be not be aligned with a consistent "X" direction as defined in the WCS (i.e., CRPIX1).
This update sidesteps both issues by ignoring the spatial step X/Y keys and computing an absolute mosaic orientation based on the (potentially corrected)
CRPIX[12] values.
