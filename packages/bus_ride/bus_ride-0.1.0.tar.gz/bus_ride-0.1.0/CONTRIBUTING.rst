Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `bus_ride` for local development.

#. Fork the `bus_ride` repo on GitHub.
#. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/bus_ride.git

#. Ensure `uv is installed`_.
#. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv::

    $ uv sync --all-groups
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pre-commit install

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

#. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests::

    $ pytest


#. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
