A simple Message Bus implementation, based on

To quote:

.. pull-quote::

    Commands capture *intent*. They express our wish for the system to do something. As
    a result, when they fail, the sender needs to receive error information.

    ‚Ä¶

    Events capture *facts* about things that happened in the past. Since we don't know
    who's handling an event, senders should not care whether the receivers succeeded or
    failed.



* Free software: MIT
* Documentation: https://bus_ride.readthedocs.io/en/latest


Features
--------

* Commands, Receivers, Events, Handlers, ReturnMessages*.


.. note::

    The purpose fulfilled by the ``ReturnMessage`` class is discussed in the book as an ‚Äúugly hack,‚Äù
    but acceptable until you are ready to fully embrace Command-Query Responsibility Segregation,
    as discussed in Chapter 12. üòÅ


Roadmap
-------

* not much actually
* tox to support more Python versions
* maybe some more tests
* maybe some documentation improvements if there is feedback
* fix that one thing ``mypy`` is complaining about
