    Run large language models in a heterogeneous decentralized environment with offloading.<br>  
</p>  

The rapid rise of generative AI has boosted demand for large language model (LLM) inference and fine-tuining services. While proprietary models are still favored, advancements in open-source LLMs have made them competitive. However, high costs and limited GPU resources hinder deployment. This work introduces BloomBee, a decentralized offline serving system that leverages idle GPU resources to provide cost-effective access to LLMs.

We rely on global GPU sharing, which includes more consumer-grade GPUs. If your GPU can only manage a small portion of a large language model, like the Llama3.1 (405B) model, you can connect to a network of servers that load different parts of the model. In this network, you can request inference or fine-tuning services.

## Installation

Before installing, make sure that your environment has Python 3.8+ and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) 1.9.0 or newer. They can be installed either
natively or with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

You can get [the latest release](https://pypi.org/project/xxxxx) with pip or build BloomBee from source.

#### With pip

If your versions of Python and PyTorch match the requirements, you can install hivemind from pip:

```
pip install bloombee
```
#### From source

To install hivemind from source, simply run the following:

##### Clone the repository:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yottalabsai/BloomBee.git  
```
##### Install the dependencies:  
```
cd BloomBee  
pip install -r requirements/requirements-dev.txt
```
```
cd BloomBee 
pip install .
```
## Run a Task    (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pENMOEoEV01DqBImZzuX_4jTV3fNwNga#scrollTo=oyCFDemCZsRs">Try now in Colab</a>)
#### 1. Set up backbone peers 
The bootstrap peers can be used as --initial_peers, to connect new GPU servers to the existing ones. They can also serve as libp2p relays for GPU servers that lack open ports (e.g., because they are behind NAT and/or firewalls).

```
python -m petals.cli.run_dht --host_maddrs /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/31340 --identity_path bootstrapp1.id 

```
Once you run it, look at the outputs and find the following line:  
```
Mon 00 01:23:45.678 [INFO] Running a DHT instance. To connect other peers to this one, use --initial_peers /ip4/YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/tcp/31340/p2p/QmefxzDL1DaJ7TcrZjLuz7Xs9sUVKpufyg7f5276ZHFjbQ
```  
You can provide this address as --initial_peers to GPU servers or other backbone peers.

If you want your swarm to be accessible outside of your local network, ensure that you have a **public IP address** or set up **port forwarding** correctly, so that your peer is reachable from the outside.

#### 2. Start servers  
Now, you can run servers with an extra --initial_peers argument pointing to your bootstrap peers:  
```
export PEER=/ip4/10.52.2.249/tcp/31340/p2p/QmefxzDL1DaJ7TcrZjLuz7Xs9sUVKpufyg7f5276ZHFjbQ  

```
```
# Machine 1  (server 1) hold 16 blocks(16 tranformer layers)
python -m petals.cli.run_server huggyllama/llama-7b --initial_peers $PEER --num_blocks 16  --identity_path bootstrap_1.id

# Machine 2  (server 2) hold another 16 blocks(16 tranformer layers)
python -m petals.cli.run_server huggyllama/llama-7b --initial_peers $PEER --num_blocks 16  --identity_path bootstrap_1.id
```

#### 3. Use the models(on servers)  

#### Inference   
```
cd Bloombee/
python benchmarks/benchmark_inference.py --model huggyllama/llama-7b  --initial_peers $PEER --torch_dtype float32 --seq_len 128
```

#### Fine-tuing  

```
cd Bloombee/
python benchmarks/benchmark_training.py --model huggyllama/llama-7b  --initial_peers $PEER --torch_dtype float32  --n_steps 20 --batch_size 32 --seq_len 128
```
