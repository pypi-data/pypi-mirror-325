    Class to load, transform and iterate over episodes, optimized for memory efficiency.
        - Using HuggingFace "load_from_disk" for loading
        - Using generators for underlying data management
        - Format changing transformations also return generators

    The sampling logic and order of episode generation is fully controlled by the `self._episode_generator` attribute.

    Each episode consists of a sequence, which has the following format:
        [
            (obs_t0, action_t0, next_obs_t0, reward_t0, terminated_t0, truncated_t0, info_t0),
            (obs_t1, action_t1, next_obs_t1, reward_t1, terminated_t1, truncated_t1, info_t1),
            ...
        ]
        Interpretation: Transition from obs to next_obs with action, receiving reward.
            Additional information returned about transition to next_obs: terminated, truncated and info.
