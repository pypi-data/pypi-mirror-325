    """Calculate the amount of cable of neuron A within distance of neuron B.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a,b :       TreeNeuron | NeuronList
                Neuron(s) for which to compute cable within distance. It is
                highly recommended to resample neurons to guarantee an even
                sampling rate.
    dist :      int | float, optional
                Maximum distance. If the neurons have their `.units` set, you
                can also provides this as a string such as "2 microns".
    method :    'min' | 'max' | 'mean' | 'forward' | 'reverse'
                Method by which to calculate the overlapping cable between
                two cables:

                  Assuming that neurons A and B have 300 and 150 um of cable
                  within given distances, respectively:

                    1. 'min' returns 150
                    2. 'max' returns 300
                    3. 'mean' returns 225
                    4. 'forward' returns 300 (i.e. A->B)
                    5. 'reverse' returns 150 (i.e. B->A)

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
            Matrix in which neurons A are rows, neurons B are columns. Cable
            within distance is given in the neuron's native units:
            ```
                        neuronD  neuronE   neuronF  ...
            neuronA         5        1         0
            neuronB        10       20         5
            neuronC         4        3        15
            ...
            ```

    See Also
    --------
    [`navis.resample_skeleton`][]
                Use to resample neurons before calculating overlap.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import navis
    >>> nl = navis.example_neurons(4)
    >>> # Cable overlap is given in the neurons' units
    >>> # Converting the example neurons from 8x8x8 voxel space into microns
    >>> # make the results easier to interpret
    >>> nl = nl.convert_units('um')
    >>> # Resample to half a micron
    >>> nl_res = nl.resample('.5 micron', inplace=False)
    >>> # Get overlapping cable within 2 microns
    >>> ol = navis.cable_overlap(nl_res[:2], nl_res[2:], dist='2 microns')
