Ratio ESL
#########

Ratio support for the  Elephant Specification Language (ESL) in Python.


**********
Quickstart
**********

Installation
============

RaESL can be installed using ``pip install raesl[all]`` for any Python version >=3.9. Or,
for Poetry managed projects, use ``poetry add raesl -E all`` to add it as a dependency.

For RaESL's different subcommands and functionality, the wheel provides extras which you could
provide instead of the ``all`` used above:

* ``doc``: documentation generation using pandoc, Markdown and optionally LaTeX.
* ``jupyter``: a Jupyter ESL kernel.
* ``pygments``: an ESL syntax highlighter for pygments.
* ``rich``: Rich doc output in the form of Plotly images.
* ``server``: A language server to parse documents.


The default ``compile`` command is always available.

Please refer to the `usage documentation <https://raesl.ratio-case.nl>`_ for more info
on how to use RaESL.
