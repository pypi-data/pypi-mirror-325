# payne

Payne allows a user to install multiple versions of a Python application at the
same time. It uses `uv` for isolation between applications and caching.

**Note**: there may be incompatible chages before version 1.0. If you use an 
earlier version, you may have to delete your applications directory and
re-install applications.
