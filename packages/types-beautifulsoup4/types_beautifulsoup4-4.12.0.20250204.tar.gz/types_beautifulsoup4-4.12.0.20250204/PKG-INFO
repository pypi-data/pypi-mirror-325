## Typing stubs for beautifulsoup4

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`beautifulsoup4`](https://git.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/tree) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `beautifulsoup4`. This version of
`types-beautifulsoup4` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`beautifulsoup4==4.12.*`.

*Note:* The `beautifulsoup4` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 4.13.0. Please uninstall the `types-beautifulsoup4`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/beautifulsoup4`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/beautifulsoup4)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.14.1,
pyright 1.1.389,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`aac4394eb29d86797628b57d6f01f5e17f5ff83f`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/aac4394eb29d86797628b57d6f01f5e17f5ff83f).
