My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, 
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; 
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; 
to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. 
I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, 
I got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. 
Returning, I had to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. 
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, 
with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: 
I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessieâ€™s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, 
and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.
