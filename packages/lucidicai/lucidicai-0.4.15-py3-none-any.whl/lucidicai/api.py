Your goal is to **complete the task** ({task}) like a human, handling all necessary steps and resolving issues dynamically.  

### Context:
- Current step: {context}  
- Previous advice given: {self.agentResponseHistory}  

### Evaluation Rules:
1. The action **must be immediately actionable on the current screen** (e.g., clicking a button, selecting an option, filling a field). If no valid action is available, determine what is preventing interaction.  
2. If a **button or element is grayed out or unclickable**, a **previous step was likely missed or incomplete**—identify what must be done to enable it and fix that first. This often requires **scrolling up** to interact with a necessary field, selection, or confirmation.  
3. Avoid repeating the same action unnecessarily.  
4. If the **same advice has been given multiple times with no effect**, identify the **underlying issue from an earlier step**, which may also require **scrolling up**, and specify the exact corrective action.  

### Output Format (Only one of the following):  
- `"Correct. Next action: Click/select/input [specific action immediately available on the current screen]."`  
- `"Incorrect. Error: Incorrect action taken. Correct action: Click/select/input [specific action immediately available on the current screen]."`  
- `"Incorrect. Error: A previous step may have been missed. Correct action: Scroll up and click/select/input [specific corrective action needed to proceed]."`

Verify with your absolute best effort whether the following action can be performed on the given screen.  
If there's any reasonable way to justify the action as possible, lean towards `"YES"`. If not, ensure `"NO"` is returned with a precise reason.  

### Input:
- **Screen Image**: We have provided an image above. 
- **Proposed Action Statement**: <PROPOSED_ACTION>  
(This will follow one of these formats:  
- `"Correct. Next action: Click/select/input [specific action immediately available on the current screen]."`  
- `"Incorrect. Error: Incorrect action taken. Correct action: Click/select/input [specific action immediately available on the current screen]."`  
- `"Incorrect. Error: A previous step may have been missed. Correct action: Scroll up and click/select/input [specific corrective action needed to proceed]."`)

### Verification Rules:
1. Extract the **specific action** from the provided statement.  
2. Carefully check if the **action is immediately visible and interactable on the current screen**.  
3. **If there's any reasonable justification for the action being possible, return `"YES"`**—no additional text, reasoning, or explanation.  
4. Return `"NO"` only if the action is definitively impossible due to one of the following:
- The element is **grayed out, missing, off-screen, or unclickable**.
- A required step (such as scrolling up or selecting a prerequisite field) **must be completed first**.
5. If `"NO"` is returned, **clearly state the reason** why the action cannot be taken and what needs to be corrected first.

### Output Format:
- `"YES"` (if the action is fully possible on the current screen, regardless of any justification provided)
- `"NO: [specific reason describing why the action cannot be performed and what must be corrected first]."`
