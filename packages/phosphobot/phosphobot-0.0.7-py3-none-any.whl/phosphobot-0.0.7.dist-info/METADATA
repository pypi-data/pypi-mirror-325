## Overview

This repository contains demo code and community projects developed using the phospho Junior Dev Kit. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can explore existing projects or contribute your own creations.

## Getting Started

1. **Get Your Dev Kit**: Purchase your Phospho Junior Dev Kit at [robots.phospho.ai](https://robots.phospho.ai). Unbox it and set it up following the instructions in the box.

2. **Control your Robot**: Donwload the Meta Quest app, connect it to your robot, start teleoperating it.

3. **Record a Dataset**: Record a dataset using the app. Do the same gesture 30 times to create a dataset.

4. **Install the Package**:

```bash
pip install --upgrade phosphobot
```

5. **Train a Model**: Use [Le Robot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) to train a policy on the dataset you just recorded.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
pip install -e .
```

Add the `configs/policy/act_so100_phosphobot.yaml`file from this repository to the `lerobot/configs/policy` directory in the `lerobot` repository.

Launch the training script with the following command from the `lerobot` repository (change the device to `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU or `cpu` if you don't have a GPU):

```bash
python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
  dataset_repo_id=YOUR_HF_DATASET_ID \
  policy=act_so100_phosphobot \
  env=so100_real \
  hydra.run.dir=outputs/train/act_so100_quickstart \
  hydra.job.name=act_so100_quickstart \
  device=mps \
  wandb.enable=false
```

## Next steps

- **Test the model**: Run the following code to test the model you just trained (TODO)
