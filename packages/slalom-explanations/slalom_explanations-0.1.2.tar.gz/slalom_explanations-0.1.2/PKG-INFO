              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# SLALOM: High-Fidelity Token-Level Explanations for Transformers

[![pytest](https://github.com/tleemann/slalom_explanations/actions/workflows/python-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=refactoring)](https://github.com/tleemann/slalom_explanations/actions/workflows/python-test.yml)

## Quickstart

A lightweight version of SLALOM can be installed using PIP:

```
pip install slalom-explanations
```
**Note:** The PIP installer contains a minimal version that allows only for computing explanations. To reproduce experiments, follow the extented setup with Conda described below.

## Basic usage

SLALOM contains an easy-to-use interface. The main commands to compute SLALOM explanations for Huggingface transformer models (SequenceClassification) are as follows:

```python
from slalom_explanations import SLALOMLocalExplanantions 
from slalom_explanations import slalom_scatter_plot

# Initialize explainer with an initialized SequenceClassification model and corresponding tokenizer
slalom_explainer = SLALOMLocalExplanantions(model, tokenizer, modes=["value", "imp"])

# Compute SLALOM explanation
example_text = "This was an amazing movie!"
res_explanation = slalom_explainer.tokenize_and_explain(example_text)

# Scatter plot
slalom_scatter_plot(res_explanation, sizey=8, sizex=8)

```


We provide the notebook ```notebooks/0_Quickstart.ipynb```, which fully runs all the steps with a pretrained model from the Huggingface hub.

## What is special about SLALOM?

<p><img align="right" width="362" height="567" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tleemann/slalom_explanations/main/SLALOM2.PNG"></p>

* SLALOM is a surrogate model explanation method that is **specifically designed for the transformer architecture.** It uses a surrogate model class that is specifically designed to model the non-linearies in attention-based models, resulting in high-fidelity explanations.
* The **explanation can be visualized in a 2D-plane** that contains a dot for each token in an input sequence. One axis describes the token *value* (its impact on the classification on its own) and the other describes the token *importance* (its interaction weight when seen in combination with other tokens).

This repository accompanies the TMLR Paper

[Attention Mechanisms Don’t Learn Additive Models: Rethinking Feature Importance For Transformers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yawWz4qWkF) 

by Tobias Leemann, Alina Fastowski, Felix Pfeiffer, and Gjergji Kasneci. The technical details of the method are described in the paper.

## Installing the full repository
To reproduce the experiments (including the competing explanation methods) you need to install additional dependencies. These cannot be installed via pip but we provide a environment file to set up a dedicated conda environment.
First setup a new environment by installing the dependencies listed in the file and activate it.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate slalom
```
You will additionally need to install the shap package by running
```
conda install -c conda-forge shap
```

Add the corresponding kernel to your existing JupyterLab installation by executing:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name slalom
```
