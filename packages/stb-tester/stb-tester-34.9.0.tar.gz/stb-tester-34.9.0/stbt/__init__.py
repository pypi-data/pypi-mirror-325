    This can be used to listen for the start of content, or for bleeps and
    bloops when navigating the UI. It returns after the first significant
    volume change. This function tries hard to give accurate timestamps for
    when the volume changed. It works best for sudden changes like a beep.

    This function detects changes in volume using a rolling window. The RMS
    volume is calculated over a rolling window of size ``window_size_secs``.
    For every sample this function compares the RMS volume in the window
    preceeding the sample, to the RMS volume in the window following the
    sample. The ratio of the two volumes determines whether the volume change
    is significant or not.

    :param stream: Audio stream to listen to. Defaults to `audio_chunks()`.

        change.

    :type window_size_secs: int
    :param window_size_secs: The time over which the RMS volume should be
        averaged. Defaults to 0.4 (400ms) in accordance with momentary loudness

        detect bleeps shorter than 400ms duration.

    :type threshold_db: float
    :param threshold_db: This controls sensitivity to volume changes. A volume
        change is considered significant if the ratio between the volume before

        ``threshold_db=10`` (the default) and
        ``direction=VolumeChangeDirection.LOUDER`` the RMS volume must increase
        by 10 dB (a factor of 3.16 in amplitude). With
        ``direction=VolumeChangeDirection.QUIETER`` the RMS volume must fall by
        10 dB.

    :type noise_floor_amplitude: float
    :param noise_floor_amplitude: This is used to avoid `ZeroDivisionError`
        exceptions.  The change from an amplitude of 0 to 0.1 is â dB.
        This isn't very practical to deal with so we consider 0 amplitude to be
        this non-zero value instead. It defaults to ~0.0003 (-70dBov). Increase
        this value if there is some sort of background noise that you want to
        ignore.

    :type timeout_secs: float
    :param timeout_secs: Timeout in seconds. If no significant volume change is
        found within this time, `VolumeChangeTimeout` will be raised and your
        test will fail.

    where there are any differences. The region where ``frame`` doesn't match
    the image is assumed to be the selection. This allows us to simultaneously
    detect the presence of a screen (used to implement a `stbt.FrameObject`
    class's ``is_visible`` property) as well as finding the selection.

    For example, to find the selection of an on-screen keyboard, ``image``
    would be a screenshot of the keyboard without any selection. You may need
    to construct this screenshot artificially in an image editor by merging two
    different screenshots.

    Unlike `stbt.match`, ``image`` must be the same size as ``frame``.

    :param image:
      The background to match against. It can be the filename of a PNG file on
      disk, or an image previously loaded with `stbt.load_image`.

      If it has an alpha channel, any transparent pixels are masked out (that
      is, the alpha channel is ANDed with ``mask``). This image must be the
      same size as ``frame``.

    :param max_size:
      The maximum size ``(width, height)`` of the differing region. If the
      differences between ``image`` and ``frame`` are larger than this in
      either dimension, the function will return a falsey result.

    :param min_size:
      The minimum size ``(width, height)`` of the differing region (optional).
      If the differences between ``image`` and ``frame`` are smaller than this
      in either dimension, the function will return a falsey result.

    :param frame:
      If this is specified it is used as the video frame to search in;
      otherwise a new frame is grabbed from the device-under-test. This is an
      image in OpenCV format (for example as returned by `stbt.frames` and
      `stbt.get_frame`).

    :param mask:
      A `Region` or a mask that specifies which parts of the image to
      analyse. This accepts anything that can be converted to a Mask using
      `stbt.load_mask`. See :doc:`masks`.

    :param threshold:
      Threshold for differences between ``image`` and ``frame`` for it to be
      considered a difference. This is a colour distance between pixels in
      ``image`` and ``frame``. 0 means the colours have to match exactly. 255
      would mean that even white (255, 255, 255) would match black (0, 0, 0).

    :param erode:
      By default we pass the thresholded differences through an erosion
      algorithm to remove noise or small anti-aliasing differences. If your
      selection is a single line less than 3 pixels wide, set this to False.

    :returns:
      An object that will evaluate to true if ``image`` and ``frame`` matched
      with a difference smaller than ``max_size``. The object has the following
      attributes:

      * **matched** (*bool*) â True if the image and the frame matched with a
        difference smaller than ``max_size``.
      * **region** (`stbt.Region`) â The bounding box that contains the
        selection (that is, the differences between ``image`` and ``frame``).
      * **mask_region** (`stbt.Region`) â The region of the frame that was
        analysed, as given in the function's ``mask`` parameter.
      * **image** (`stbt.Image`) â The reference image given to
        ``find_selection_from_background``.
      * **frame** (`stbt.Frame`) â The video-frame that was analysed.

    ``stbt.find_selection_from_background`` was added in v32.

    Changed in v33: ``mask`` accepts anything that can be converted to a Mask
    using `load_mask` (previously it only accepted a `Region`).

            def navigate_to(self, target):
                return stbt.navigate_1d(target, page=self,
                                        direction=stbt.Direction.HORIZONTAL)

    :param target: Navigate to this menu item. Typically a string.

    :param page: An instance of a `stbt.FrameObject` sub-class that represents
        the current state of the menu. We will use this object's ``focus``
        property to determine which item is currently focused. After we have
        pressed up, down, left, or right, we will call this object's
        `refresh <stbt.FrameObject.refresh>` method to read the new state from
        the screen.

    :param direction: Direction to move in: Either `Direction.VERTICAL` (for
        navigation with "KEY_DOWN" and "KEY_UP") or `Direction.HORIZONTAL` (for
        navigation with "KEY_RIGHT" and "KEY_LEFT").

    :param mask: A mask to use when calling `stbt.press_and_wait` to determine
        when the current focus has finished moving. Usually this will be a
        `Region` specifying where the menu is on the screen, but it can also be
        a more complex :doc:`mask <masks>`.

    :param timeout_secs: Raise `NavigationFailed` if we still haven't found the
        target after this many seconds.

    :param get_focus: By default, ``navigate_1d`` will use the ``page`` object's
        ``focus`` property to determine which item is currently focused. You can
        override this behaviour by providing a function that takes a single
        argument (the ``page`` instance) and returns the focused menu item.

    :param eq: A function that compares two strings (the current focus and the
        target), and returns True if they match. The default is `stbt.ocr_eq`,
        which ignores common OCR errors.

    :param press_and_wait: ``navigate_1d`` will call `stbt.press_and_wait` with
        the appropriate key ("KEY_DOWN", "KEY_UP", "KEY_LEFT", or "KEY_RIGHT")
        to move the focus and wait until it has finished moving. If you need to
        customise the parameters to `press_and_wait`, you can pass in your own
        function here: It should accept a key name and call the real
        `stbt.press_and_wait` with your extra parameters. For example::

            def my_press_and_wait(key):
                return stbt.press_and_wait(
                    key, mask=stbt.Region(...), timeout_secs=10)
            ...
            return stbt.navigate_1d(
                target, page=self, direction=stbt.Direction.HORIZONTAL,
                press_and_wait=my_press_and_wait)

        In many cases a `lambda` (anonymous function) is more convenient::

            return stbt.navigate_1d(
                target, page=self, direction=stbt.Direction.HORIZONTAL,
                press_and_wait=lambda key: stbt.press_and_wait(
                    key, mask=stbt.Region(...), timeout_secs=10))

    :param recover: A function that will recover if navigation "falls off" the
        edge of the menu onto a different page.

        "Falling off" means that ``page.is_visible`` is False after navigating
        up, down, left or right.

        By default, ``navigate_1d`` will try to recover by pressing the
        opposite key (for example, "KEY_LEFT" if it had fallen off after
        pressing "KEY_RIGHT"), and if that fails, it will try "KEY_BACK". To use
        a different recovery strategy, specify your own function here.

        The function should take a single argument of type
        `stbt.NavigationState`. It should do the appropriate actions to get back
        onto the menu that we were navigating, and then return a new Page Object
        that represents the new state of the menu. For example::

            def my_recover(state: stbt.NavigationState):
                assert stbt.press_and_wait("KEY_BACK")
                return Menu()

            stbt.navigate_1d(..., recover=my_recover)

        If necessary, you can check the function's parameter to see the previous
        Page Object (before falling off) and the last key that was pressed.

        Your recovery function doesn't have to get back to the same menu item
        that was focused before falling off; it just needs to get back onto the
        menu. For example, if your Page Object has a staticmethod called
        ``open`` that will open the menu from any state, you can use that to
        recover, like this::

            stbt.navigate_1d(..., recover=lambda _: Menu.open())

        The ``recover`` parameter can also be a string, which is the name of
        a key for `stbt.press`. ``navigate_1d`` will attempt to recover by
        pressing that key once.

    :param learning: We can remember the items we discovered during navigation
        so that the next time you call ``navigate_1d`` we can use that
        information to navigate faster. To disable this behaviour, pass
        ``learning=stbt.Learning.NONE``. See `stbt.Learning`.

        If the actual menu of the device-under-test doesn't match the learned
        menu structure, this function will still work â it will fall back to the
        searching behaviour.

    :param id: A unique identifier for this menu. You only need to specify this
        if ``learning`` is enabled and you are using the same FrameObject class
        to recognize many different menus and sub-menus.

    :returns: A new FrameObject instance of the same type as ``page``,
        reflecting the device-under-test's new state after the navigation
        completed.

    :raises NavigationFailed: If we can't find the target.
