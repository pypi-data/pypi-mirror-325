"""
The purpose of the BigImage class is to provide a method to manage and display a very Big Image
without having to worry too much about the memory restrictions. The image is constructed
by placing blocks of pixels at their positions (i.e. the top corner of the block).
The class BigImage will return a preview decimated (i.e. reduced) by 'factor' (an integer) to make it manageable
and possible to display reasonably well.  It makes it possible to work with an image that would be several GB without
sacrificing speed: for instance, and image of 1 GB made of 17x17x2048x2048 images can be displayed in less than a second.
