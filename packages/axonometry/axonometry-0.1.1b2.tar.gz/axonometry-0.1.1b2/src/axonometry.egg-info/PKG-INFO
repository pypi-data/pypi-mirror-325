## What is _axonometry_?

_axonometry_ is a scripting library to generate axonometric drawings. It implements axonometric projection operations common in the context of architectural representation. _axonometry_ enables the exploration of three dimensional representation through the definition of projecitonal operations. Think of it as a tool for generative drawing art, oriented towards architectutral representation.

_axonometry_ is the top of the iceberg of a PhD project at the [AlICe laboratory](https://alicelab.be). It is the result of a practical experimentations around questions related to the field of architectural representation, the role of computer graphics and drawing practices.

Check the [documentation](https://axonometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more thorough introduction to _axonometry_.

## How does it work?

_axonometry_ is basically a wrapper for [compas](https://compas.dev) geometry objects and produces SVG vector files with the help of [vpype](https://vpype.readthedocs.io).

## Examples

You don't like computers and just want an axonometry layout and continue drawing by hand:
```python
import axonometry as axo
my_axo = axo.Axonometry(15,45)
my_axo.save_svg("new_drawing")
```

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available in the [latest documentation](https://axonometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

TL;DR:
- Python 3.12 is recommended, but _axonometry_ is also compatible with Python 3.10 and 3.11.
- _axonometry_ is published on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/axonometry/).

```bash
python -m pip install axonometry
```
