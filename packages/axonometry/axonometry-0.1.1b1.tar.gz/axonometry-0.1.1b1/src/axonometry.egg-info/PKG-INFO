## What is _axonometry_?

_axonometry_ is actualizing pre-CAD geometry and instrumental drawing knowledge.

_axonometry_ is the top of the iceberg of my PhD project in Architecture

Check the [documentation](https://axonometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more thorough introduction to _axonometry_.

## How does it work?

_axonometry_ is a scripting library to generate axonometric vector drawings.

## Examples

You don't like computers and just want an axonometry layout and continue drawing by hand:
```python
import axonometry
axo = axonometry.Axonometry(15,45)
axo.save_svg()
```

## What _axonometry_ isn't?

_axonometry_ caters to plotter generative art and does not aim to be a general purpose (think
Illustrator/InkScape) vector graphic tools. One of the main reason for this is the fact _axonometry_ converts everything
curvy (circles, bezier curves, etc.) to lines made of small segments. _axonometry_ does import metadata such stroke and fill color, stroke width, etc., it only makes partial use of them and does not aim to maintain a full consistency with the SVG specification. These design choices make _axonometry_'s rich feature set possible, but limits its use for, e.g., printed media.

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available in the [latest documentation](https://axonometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

TL;DR:
- Python 3.12 is recommended, but _axonometry_ is also compatible with Python 3.10 and 3.11.
- _axonometry_ is published on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/axonometry/).

```bash
python -m pip install axonometry
```
