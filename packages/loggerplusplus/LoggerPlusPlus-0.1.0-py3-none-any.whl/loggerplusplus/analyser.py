# ====== Code Summary ======
# This script defines a `LogAnalyser` class that reads execution logs from a specified file,
# extracts function execution times using regular expressions, and plots them using Matplotlib.
# The script supports filtering execution times for specific function names and reports
# average execution times.

# ====== Imports ======
# Standard library imports
import re

# Third-party library imports
