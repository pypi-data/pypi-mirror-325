### Introduction

The [IETF] uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it publishes as [RFCs], and for the draft documents which are produced when developing documents for publications. There exists a number of different tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them. It takes as input an xml file that contains the text and meta-information about author names etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output. The input xml file should follow the grammars in [RFC7749] *(for v2 documents)* or [RFC7991] *(for v3 documents)*. Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and changes will eventually be captured in the [bis draft for 7991]. Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source [v3.rng], or in the [documentation xml2rfc produces] with its `--doc` flag.

**xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to v3, and can run the [preptool] on its input.

### Installation

Installation of the python package is done as usual with `pip install xml2rfc`, using appropriate switches.

#### Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter

In order to generate PDFs, **xml2rfc** uses the [WeasyPrint] module, which depends on external libraries that must be installed as native packages on your platform, separately from the **xml2rfc** install.

1. First, install the **Pango**, and other required libraries on your system.  See installation instructions on the [WeasyPrint Docs].

2. Next, install WeasyPrint python modules using pip.

```sh
pip install "xml2rfc[pdf]"
```
3. Finally, install the required fonts:
  * Download latest fonts from [xml2rfc-fonts](https://github.com/ietf-tools/xml2rfc-fonts/releases/latest).
  * In the **Assets** section, download either the `tar.gz` or the `zip` archive.
  * Extract the contents of the downloaded `xml2rfc-fonts` archive.
  * Install the fonts found in the `noto` and `roboto_mono` directories to your operating system.

With these installed and available to **xml2rfc**, the `--pdf` switch will be enabled.

### Usage

**xml2rfc** accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.

#### Basic Usage

```sh
xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...
```

Run `xml2rfc --help` for a full listing of command-line options.

### Getting Started

This project is following the standard **Git Feature Workflow** development model. Learn about all the various steps of the development workflow, from creating a fork to submitting a pull request, in the [Contributing](https://github.com/ietf-tools/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

> Make sure to read the [Styleguides](https://github.com/ietf-tools/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides) section to ensure a cohesive code format across the project.

You can submit bug reports, enhancements and new feature requests in the [discussions](https://github.com/ietf-tools/xml2rfc/discussions) area. Accepted tickets will be converted to issues.

#### Git Cloning Tips

As outlined in the [Contributing](https://github.com/ietf-tools/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide, you will first want to create a fork of the xml2rfc project in your personal GitHub account before cloning it.

For example *(replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username)*:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/xml2rfc.git
```
#### Docker Dev Environment

Run `./run.sh` command to build and start a docker development environment.
The initial build may take time because it downloads all required fonts as well.


```sh
./run.sh
```
