"""Simplify the connection to DS9 using SAMP.

This is a simplified interface to talking to DS9 with SAMP, and
assumes certain things, such as:

- a SAMP hub is running,
- the DS9 instance remains connected to it while the module is run,
- there is only one DS9 instance to talk to,
- connections with other SAMP capable clients is not needed,
- and commands are to be executed synchronously (i.e. each command is
  executed and acknowledged by DS9 before the next command is processed).

For more complex cases see the `DS9 SAMP documentation <https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9/ds9-astropy>`_
and the `AstroPy SAMP module
<https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/samp/>`_.

Please note that SAMP is not designed as a secure connection system,
and this module assumes that if a SAMP client supports ds9.set and
ds9.get methods then it is DS9 (or a valid DS9 emulator).

Simple usage
------------

The ds9samp.ds9samp routine is used to create a object that can control
the DS9 instance:

    import ds9samp
    with ds9samp.ds9samp() as ds9:
        ds9.set("frame delete all")
        ds9.set("url http://ds9.si.edu/download/data/img.fits")
        ds9.set("zscale")
        ds9.set("cmap viridis")

The get method will return a value (as a string, FITS HDUList, NumPy
array, or None if there is no response).

Syntax errors are displayed as a screen message (to stdout) but they
do not stop the connection. Lower-level errors - such as the DS9
instance being closed - will raise an error and this will exit the
context manager, and so the connection will be closed.

Direct access
-------------

The `ds9samp.start` routine will return an object that the user is
required to close, via `ds9samp.end`. The previous example can be
written as:

    import ds9samp
    ds9 = ds9samp.start()
    try:
        ds9.set("frame delete all")
        ds9.set("url http://ds9.si.edu/download/data/img.fits")
        ds9.set("zscale")
        ds9.set("cmap viridis")
    finally:
        ds9.end()

Sending images directly
-----------------------

It is possible to send DS9 the contents of a NumPy array directly
by using the `NumPy memmap
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.memmap.html>`_
call to create a temporary file. This has been automated with the
`send_array` call. For example:

    import numpy as np
    import ds9samp
    # Create a rotated elliptical gaussian
    x0 = 2200
    x1 = 3510
    theta = 1.2
    ellip = 0.4
    fwhm = 400
    x1s, x0s = np.mgrid[3000:4001, 2000:2501]
    dx0 = (x0s - x0) * np.cos(theta) + (x1s - x1) * np.sin(theta)
    dx1 = (x1s - x1) * np.cos(theta) - (x0s - x0) * np.sin(theta)
    r2 = ((dx0 * (1 - ellip))**2  + dx1**2) / (fwhm * (1 - ellip))**2
    img = np.exp(-4 * np.log(2) * r2)
    # Send it to DS9
    with ds9samp.ds9samp() as ds9:
        ds9.send_array(img)
        ds9.set("cmap viridis")

For more complex cases the creation of the memmap-ed file should be
done manually, as described in the `DS9 example
<https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9/ds9-astropy>`_.

3D data
^^^^^^^

3D data can be sent and retrieved with `send_array` and
`retrieve_array`. If the data should be treated as RGB, HLS, or HSV
data - that is, the third dimension has 3 elements representing

- red, green, and blue channels
- hue, lightness, and saturation
- hue, saturation, and value

then the `send_array` should be called setting the `cube` argument to
a value from the `Cube` enumeration; that is `Cube.RGB`, `Cube.HLS`,
or `Cube.HSV`.

FITS data
^^^^^^^^^

FITS data - as represented by AstroPy `FITS objects
<https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html>`_ - can
also be sent and retrieved, as of version 0.0.7, using the
`send_fits` and `retrieve_fits` methods.

If a table is sent, then DS9 will select what columns to bin, although
the `bin command <https://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/samp.html#bin>`_ can be
used to control the process. Attempts to retrieve a FITS file from
such a dataset will return an image, and not the underlying table.

Catalogs
--------

As of version 0.0.8, catalogs can be sent and retrieved using the
`send_cat` and `retrieve_cat` methods. The `send_cat` method
will send an AstroPy `Table <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/index.html>`_
or a `FITS table <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html>`_
to DS9, and `retrieve_cat` returns a `Table`.

Timeouts
--------

The default timeout for the set and get calls is 10 seconds, and this
can be changed by either setting the timeout attribute of the
connection, or by over-riding this value for a single call with the
timeout parameter for the get and set methods. Note that the timeout
must be an integer, and 0 is used to turn off the timeout.

For get calls it is suggested to set the timeout to 0 if the command
requires user interaction, such as selecting a location.

How to connect to a particular DS9 instance
-------------------------------------------

If there are multiple DS9 instances connected to the SAMP hub then
ds9samp.ds9samp or ds9samp.start must be called with the client
argument set to select the DS9 instance to talk to.

The ds9samp.list_ds9 routine returns a list of client names to use.
Unfortunately it's not immediately obvious how to map a client name to
a particular instance. One solution is to ask DS9 to display a window
with a command like

    % ds9samp_set "analysis message og {Selected window}" --name cl3 --timeout 0

(replacing cl3 by one of the values reported by list_samp).
