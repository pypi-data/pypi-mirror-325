Poly Packet is a set of tools aimed at generating protocols from embedded projects. Protocols are described in an YAML document which can be easily shared with all components of a system.

A python script is used to parse the YAML file and generate C/C++ code as well as documentation. The code generation tool can create the back end service, application layer, and even an entire linux utility app
