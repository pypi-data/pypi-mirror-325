  purse.logging.setup(
    telegram_setup=TelegramSetup(
        bot=logging.SimpleLoggingBot(token=bot_config.get('token')),
        log_chat_id=bot_config.get('log_chat_id'),
        send_delay=bot_config.getint('send_delay'),
        logger_level=bot_config.getint('logger_level'),
        service_name=bot_config.get('service_name'),
    ),
  )
