Key Improvements in Version 1.0+
````````````````````````````````

* pickleDB 1.0 is a reimagined version designed for speed, simplicity, and reliability. This version is NOT backwards compatible. Key changes include:
* Atomic Saves: Ensures data integrity during writes, eliminating potential corruption issues.
* Faster Serialization: Switched to `orjson` for significantly improved speed.
* Streamlined API: Removed legacy methods (e.g., `ladd`, `dmerge`) in favor of native Python operations.
* Unified Handling of Data Types: Treats all Python-native types (lists, dicts, etc.) as first-class citizens.
* Explicit Saves: The `auto_save` feature was removed to provide users greater control and optimize performance.
* Added fully built in async class for use with even based applications.
