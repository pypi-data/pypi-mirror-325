# Jupyter Events

_An event system for Jupyter Applications and extensions._

Jupyter Events enables Jupyter Python Applications (e.g. Jupyter Server, JupyterLab Server, JupyterHub, etc.) to emit **events**â€”structured data describing things happening inside the application. Other software (e.g. client applications like JupyterLab) can _listen_ and respond to these events.

## Install
