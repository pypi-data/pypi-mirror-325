# pynanoflann

This is a fork of [a fork](https://github.com/dwastberg/pynanoflann) of [the unofficial python wrapper](https://github.com/u1234x1234/pynanoflann) to the [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) library.

The nanoflann implementation of [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) provides one of the best performance for many k-nearest neighbour problems.

The main distinguishing feature of this fork is that it's installable from pip. None of the actual code has been modified. 

# Install

```
pip install pynanoflann
```
