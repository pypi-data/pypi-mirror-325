## Community
üê´ CAMEL is an open-source community dedicated to finding the scaling laws of agents. We believe that studying these agents on a large scale offers valuable insights into their behaviors, capabilities, and potential risks. To facilitate research in this field, we implement and support various types of agents, tasks, prompts, models, and simulated environments.

Join us ([*Discord*](https://discord.camel-ai.org/), [*WeChat*](https://ghli.org/camel/wechat.png) or [*Slack*](https://join.slack.com/t/camel-ai/shared_invite/zt-2g7xc41gy-_7rcrNNAArIP6sLQqldkqQ)) in pushing the boundaries of finding the scaling laws of agents.

## What Can You Build With CAMEL?

### ü§ñ Customize Agents
- Customizable agents are the fundamental entities of the CAMEL architecture. CAMEL empowers you to customize agents using our modular components for specific tasks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Multi-Agent Systems
- We propose a multi-agent framework to address agents' autonomous cooperation challenges, guiding agents toward task completion while maintaining human intentions.

### üíª Practical Applications
- The CAMEL framework serves as a generic infrastructure for a wide range of multi-agent applications, including task automation, data generation, and world simulations.


## Why Should You Use CAMEL?

1. Comprehensive Customization and Collaboration:

    - Integrates over 20 advanced model platforms (e.g., commercial models like OpenAI, open-source models such as Llama3, and self-deployment frameworks like Ollama).

    - Supports extensive external tools (e.g., Search, Twitter, Github, Google Maps, Reddit, Slack utilities).
    - Includes memory and prompt components for deep customization.
    - Facilitates complex multi-agent systems with advanced collaboration features.


2. User-Friendly with Transparent Internal Structure:
    - Designed for transparency and consistency in internal structure.

    - Offers comprehensive [tutorials and detailed docstrings](https://docs.camel-ai.org/) for all functions.
    - Ensures an approachable learning curve for newcomers.


## Try It Yourself
We provide a [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AzP33O8rnMW__7ocWJhVBXjKziJXPtim?usp=sharing) demo showcasing a conversation between two ChatGPT agents playing roles as a python programmer and a stock trader collaborating on developing a trading bot for stock market.

## Installation

### From PyPI

To install the base CAMEL library:
```bash
pip install camel-ai
```

> **Note**: Some features may not work without their required dependencies. Install `camel-ai[all]` to ensure all dependencies are available, or install specific extras based on the features you need.

```bash
pip install 'camel-ai[all]'  # Replace with options below
```

- `all`: Includes all features below
- `model_platforms`: OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Anthropic Claude, Cohere etc.
- `huggingface`: Transformers, Diffusers, Accelerate, Datasets, PyTorch etc.
- `rag`: Sentence Transformers, Qdrant, Milvus, BM25 etc.

- `data_tools`: Pandas, TextBlob, DataCommons, OpenBB, Stripe etc.
- `research_tools`: arXiv, Google Scholar etc.
- `dev_tools`: Docker, Jupyter, Tree-sitter, Code Interpreter etc.

Multiple extras can be combined using commas:
```bash
pip install 'camel-ai[rag,web_tools,document_tools]'  # Example: RAG system with web search and document processing
```

### From Docker

Detailed guidance can be found [here](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/blob/master/.container/README.md)

## Quick Start

By default, the agent uses the `ModelType.DEFAULT` model from the `ModelPlatformType.DEFAULT`. You can configure the default model platform and model type using environment variables. If these are not set, the agent will fall back to the default settings:

```bash
ModelPlatformType.DEFAULT = "openai"
ModelType.DEFAULT = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Setting Default Model Platform and Model Type (Optional)

You can customize the default model platform and model type by setting the following environment variables:
```bash
export DEFAULT_MODEL_PLATFORM_TYPE=<your preferred platform>  # e.g., openai, anthropic, etc.
export DEFAULT_MODEL_TYPE=<your preferred model>  # e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o-mini, etc.
```

### Setting Your Model API Key (Using OpenAI as an Example)

**For Bash shell (Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows):**

```bash
# Export your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<insert your OpenAI API key>
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=<insert your OpenAI API BASE URL>  #(Should you utilize an OpenAI proxy service, kindly specify this)
```

**For Windows Command Prompt:**

```cmd
REM export your OpenAI API key
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<insert your OpenAI API key>
set OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=<insert your OpenAI API BASE URL>  #(Should you utilize an OpenAI proxy service, kindly specify this)
```

**For Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Export your OpenAI API key
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<insert your OpenAI API key>"
$env:OPENAI_API_BASE_URL="<insert your OpenAI API BASE URL>"  #(Should you utilize an OpenAI proxy service, kindly specify this)
```

Replace `<insert your OpenAI API key>` with your actual OpenAI API key in each case. Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign.


Please note that the environment variable is session-specific. If you open a new terminal window or tab, you will need to set the API key again in that new session.

**For `.env` File:**

To simplify the process of managing API Keys, you can use store information in a `.env` file and load them into your application dynamically.

1. Modify .env file in the root directory of CAMEL and fill the following lines:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<fill your API KEY here>
```

Replace <fill your API KEY here> with your actual API key.

2. Load the .env file in your Python script: Use the load_dotenv() function from the dotenv module to load the variables from the .env file into the environment. Here's an example:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from the .env file
load_dotenv()
```
For more details about the key names in project and how to apply key, 
you can refer to [here](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/.env).

> [!TIP]
> By default, the load_dotenv() function does not overwrite existing environment variables that are already set in your system. It only populates variables that are missing.
If you need to overwrite existing environment variables with the values from your `.env` file, use the `override=True` parameter:
> ```python
> load_dotenv(override=True)
> ```

After setting the OpenAI API key, you can run the `role_playing.py` script. Find tasks for various assistant-user roles [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/194PPaSTBR07m-PzjS-Ty6KlPLdFIPQDd/view?usp=share_link).

```bash
# You can change the role pair and initial prompt in role_playing.py
python examples/ai_society/role_playing.py
```

Also feel free to run any scripts below that interest you:

```bash
# You can change the role pair and initial prompt in these python files

# Examples of two agents role-playing
python examples/ai_society/role_playing.py

# The agent answers questions by utilizing code execution tools.
python examples/toolkits/code_execution_toolkit.py

# Generating a knowledge graph with an agent
python examples/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph_agent_example.py  

# Multiple agents collaborating to decompose and solve tasks
python examples/workforce/multiple_single_agents.py 

# Use agent to generate creative image
python examples/vision/image_crafting.py
```
