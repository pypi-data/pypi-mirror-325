def get_torch_platform(discrete_gpu_infos):
    """
    Determine the appropriate PyTorch platform to use based on the system architecture, OS, and GPU information.

    Args:
        discrete_gpu_infos (list of tuples): A list where each tuple represents a GPU. Each tuple contains:
            - vendor_id (int): The vendor ID of the GPU (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL constants).
            - other details (e.g., model, memory, etc., not used directly in this function).

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the platform to use. Possible values:
            - "cpu": No discrete GPUs or unsupported configuration.
            - "cuXXX": NVIDIA CUDA version (e.g., "cu124").
            - "rocmXXX": AMD ROCm version (e.g., "rocm6.2").
            - "directml": DirectML for AMD or Intel GPUs on Windows.
            - "ipex": Intel Extension for PyTorch for Linux.
            - "xpu": Intel's backend for PyTorch.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: For unsupported architectures, OS-GPU combinations, or multiple GPU vendors.
        Warning: Outputs warnings for deprecated Python versions or fallback configurations.
