Sale Order Report Hide Discounts by Partner
===========================================

This module allows you to show the discounts on sale reports if based on the partner.

In order not to show the discounts in the sale reports, on the one hand hide the discount columns and 
on the other hand recalculate the unit price including the discount.

=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to the contacts module 
#. Create or Edit a parent contact
#. Go to Sale & Purchase tab

To configure unit price decimal precision to show the unit price with discounts:

#. With developer permissions go to Technical settings. 
#. Go to Decimal Accuracy.
