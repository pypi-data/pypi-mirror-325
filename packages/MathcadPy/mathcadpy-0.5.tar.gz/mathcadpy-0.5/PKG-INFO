# MathcadPy


[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/MathcadPy.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/MathcadPy/)  [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/mathcadpy)](https://pepy.tech/project/mathcadpy)

A Python wrapper for the Mathcad Prime automation API.  See [the Wiki](https://github.com/MattWoodhead/MathcadPy/wiki/0.-Home) for the module documentation.

### Requirements
- [Mathcad Prime 3+](https://www.mathcad.com/)
- [win32com](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)

### Features
MathcadPy is a python wrapper for the Mathcad Prime COM automation API. This allows a python script to interact with a Mathcad session, select worksheets that are already open or open worksheets from files, and send values to designated inputs and fetch them from designated outputs. The python script also has access to the worksheet units, and can even demand results in different units to those specified in a worksheet (e.g. calculation may output a value in meters, but the script wants the value in inches).

### Usage
Install using: `pip install MathcadPy`
 
See [the Wiki](https://github.com/MattWoodhead/MathcadPy/wiki/0.-Home) for the module documentation.

See examples.py for some simple function examples including matrix operations.
