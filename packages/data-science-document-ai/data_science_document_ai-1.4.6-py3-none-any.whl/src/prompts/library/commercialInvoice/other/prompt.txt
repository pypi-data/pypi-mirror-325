Task: You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the response schema provided.

Extract all the data points from the given document.
Each data point is part of a master field called skus. There may be multiple skus entries in a document.

Instructions:
- Do not change the keys of the following dictionary.
- The values should be filled in as per the response schema provided.
- The entity can be extracted multiple times. Please pay attention to the occurrence_type.
- Use the data field description to understand the context of the data.
- Pay attention to the column names in the table to understand the context of the data.
- packagingQuantity:
    - Please give priority to the Pallets, PLT, or Cartons, CTN, and then PCS field in the table to extract the data for the quantity field.
    - Do not extract the packQuantity field such as PCS/CTN, etc.
- packagingType:
    - Please extract the unit associated with the packagingQuantity from the table to extract the "packagingType"
    - Sometimes it can be found on the column name of the "packagingQuantity" from the table to extract the "packagingType"
- measurement:
    - The measurement is measured in "Cubic Meter (cbm)" or dimensions. But volume in "cbm" is preferred
- goodsDescription:
    - Extract only the description of the goods for the "goodsDescription" but not other information like packing, marks, etc.

    - If currency is not found, please look for the column name of the "amount" in the table to extract the currency.

- If containerNumber, hsCode, poNumber, or currency are not found within a skus entity, look for these fields elsewhere in the document. Once found, insert these fields to all relevant "skus" entities by populating their respective fields.
- Do not create additional "skus" entries separately for these shared attributes; instead, insert them to existing "skus" entries by populating their respective fields.
- Do not extract or associate the total Gross Weight, total Net Weight, or quantityShipped fields with any "skus" entity. These fields are document-level fields and should not be associated with any skus entity.
