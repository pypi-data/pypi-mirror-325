# FastHTML Developer Utils


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Why?

Here’s a brief outline of the benefits of using `fh-dev-utils`.

1.  Super-easy to dynamically build Tailwind styles!
2.  Compatible with [TailwindCSS
    v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).
3.  Cach buster to bypass browser styles during development.
4.  Run a Jupyter notebook server alongside your FastHTML app.
5.  Database browser to easily view/manage your apps db tables and
    records.
6.  TailwindCSS intellisense for a great developer experience.

It’s recommended by the authors of TailwindCSS uses a build step to
compile styles for published websites, rather than just add the CDN
version to the site header.

And if you like using Tailwind for your app styling then make sure you
[enable intellisense](#tailwind-intellisense). This is only available if
you dynamically build your styles. Being able to see inline color
information, all available tailwind classes, and what CSS a class will
be converted into is a game-changer!

A complete list of the benefits of compiling TailwindCSS styles can be
found [here](#tailwindcss-dynamic-build).

## Introduction

The `fh-dev-utils` package helps during the devlopment of FastHTML
applications by adding support for live TailwindCSS build, a Jupyter
notebook server, and an SQLite viewer/manager via the `serve_dev()`
function.

There is also a `cache_buster()` function available to help prevent
caching of CSS styles during development.

See [here](https://exploringml.github.io/fh-dev-utils/serve_dev.html)
for the full definition of `serve_dev()` and `cache_buster()` plus all
available parameters.

## Usage

Install the `fh-dev-utils` package from PyPi.

``` sh
$ pip install fh-dev-utils
```

Then import the `fh_dev_utils` package inside your FastHTML application.

`main.py`

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from fh_dev_utils.serve import *

app,rt = fast_app(live=True)

@rt('/')
def get(): return Div(P('Hello World!'))

#serve()
serve_dev()
```

Replace the default `serve()` function with `serve_dev()`. This performs
the same functionality as `serve()` but includes a few additional
enhancements, which make developing FastHTML applications a little
easier.

Currently `serve_dev()` offers three main features.

1.  TailwindCSS styles dynamic build process
2.  Jupyter notebook server
3.  SQLite database browser

Note: If you use `serve_dev()` without any options then it performs the
exact same function as `serve()`.

## 1. TailwindCSS Dynamic Build

Uses the TailwindCSS CLI to dynamically build styles as you edit your
apps source code.

Benefits include:

- Smaller CSS files size (only build what you have defined)
- Recommended best practice from the authors of TailwindCSS:
  - > The \[Play\] CDN is designed for development purposes only, and is
    > not intended for production.
- Use dynamic selectors such as `mb-[34px]`
- TailwindCSS intellisense support
- Custom configuration (e.g. plugins, and custom themes)

``` python
serve_dev(tw=True)
```

When you start a FastHTML app with the `tw` parameter enabled you’ll see
an additional link to open Jupyter Lab. By default the source
TailwindCSS file is assumed to be located in `./app.css` and the output
is saved to `./public/app.css`. Both these paths can be configured by
the `tw_src` and `tw_dist` parameters respectively.

``` sh
$ python main.py
Watching for Tailwind class changes...
Link: http://localhost:5001
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/home/david/fh-dev-utils-test']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [1951725] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [1951759]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

### TailwindCSS Setup

The `serve_dev(tw=True)` function runs the TailwindCSS CLI to watch for
class name changes but you need to setup your FastHTML to be Tailwind
‘compatible’. This means adding a Tailwind source CSS file and a config
file.

In the root of your FastTML project add an `app.css` file:

``` css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

This is for TailwindCSS v4. If you’re using an older version then use
this format instead:

``` css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

If your Tailwind CSS file is named something other then `app.css` or is
in a different location then you can use the `tw_src` parameter in
`serve_dev()` to change the name/path as required.

The last thing to do is add the generated Tailwind CSS file to the
header of your FastHTML site.

``` python
app,rt,todos,ToDo = fast_app(
    pico=False,
    live=True,
    hdrs=(
        Link(rel="stylesheet", href=f"/public/app.css{cache_buster() if DEV_MODE else ""}", type="text/css"),
    ),
)
```

This will add the necessary styles and will also bypass the browser CSS
cache via the `fh-dev-utils` `cache_buster()` function.

### Tailwind Intellisense

One of the advantages to building TailwindCSS styles dynamically is that
it enables support for auto-completion (intellisense) of Tailwind
classes as you type.

To get this working you need to be using VS Code and install the
[Tailwind CSS
IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
extension.

You also need to edit the TailwindCSS VS Code settings so that
intellisense is auto-triggered as you edit your FastHTML app source
code.

Open the JSON user settings in VS Code and add the following settings to
the existing ones:

``` json
 {
  "tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "python": "html"
  },
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "\\b[a-zA-Z_]+\\s*=\\s*[\"']([^\"']*)[\"']",
    "\"[^\"]+\"\\s*:\\s*\"([^\"]*)\"",
    "'[^']+'\\s*:\\s*'([^']*)'"
  ],
}
```

Once this is set up then you get full intellisense support.

Plus, all colors are highlighted inline too, and you can hover over the
Tailwind class to see what the computed CSS will be when rendered!

### Troubleshooting

If you don’t see a little color swatch next to the Tailwind color
classes then intellisense isn’t working. This is usually because the
TailwindCSS CLI is not running, or you don’t have a `tailwind.config.js`
added to the root of your FastHTML app.

Also, if you are using Linux under Windows (WSL) then make sure the
Tailwind CSS Intellisense VS Code extension is enabled for WSL.

## 2. Jupyter Notebook Server

It is often really useful to add one or more notebooks to your FastHTML
to enable quick exploration or research when developing you app. Use it
to test things out or as a scratch pad to try out ideas. You can then
transfer any code you want to incorporate into the FastHTML app.

The `serve_dev()` function makes this super-easy. Simply set the
`jupyter` argument to `True`:

``` python
serve_dev(jupyter=True)
```

When you start a FastHTML app with the `jupyter` parameter enabled
you’ll see an additional link to open Jupyter Lab. By default port 8036
will be used for the Jupyter lab server but this can be changed via the
`jupyter_port` parameter.

``` sh
$ python main.py
Jupyter Lab link: http://localhost:8036/lab
Link: http://localhost:5001
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/home/david/fh-dev-utils-test']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [1951725] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [1951759]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This will give you access to a full Jupyter Lab server that runs along
side your FastHTML app.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExploringML/fh-dev-utils/main/nbs/assets/jupyter-1.png" width="750" />

A particularly useful way to use a notebook to complement your FastHTML
app is to view the schema for an SQLite database (only relevant if your
app includes a database).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExploringML/fh-dev-utils/main/nbs/assets/jupyter-2.png" width="750" />

Note: The `fastlite` `diagram()` function requires
[`graphviz`](https://graphviz.org/) to be installed.

## 3. SQLite Database Browser

When working with an SQLite database in your FastHTML app it is often
useful to be able to easily view/edit database data. You can also do
this manually via a Jupyter Lab notebook too but it is very convenient
to have a dedicated app to be able to interect with your database.

We have included support for the
[`sqlite-web`](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlite-web) browser which is
written in Python.

``` python
serve_dev(db=True)
```

When you start a FastHTML app with the `db` parameter enabled you’ll see
an additional link to open sqlite-web database browser. By default port
8035 will be used for the SQLite browser but this can be changed via the
`sqlite_port` parameter. The database file can be configured via
`db_path`. By default it is set to `./data/app.db`.

``` sh
$ python main.py
SQLite link: http://localhost:8035
Link: http://localhost:5001
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/home/david/fh-dev-utils-test']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [1988346] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [1988418]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

This will give you access to a full sqlite-web database server that runs
along side your FastHTML app.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExploringML/fh-dev-utils/main/nbs/assets/sqlite-web-1.png" width="750" />

## Enabling All Options

If you enable TailwindCSS file watching, Jupyter Lab server, and
sqlite-web database browser altogether then the console output will look
like this when you first start a FastHTML app.

``` sh
$ python main.py
Watching for Tailwind class changes...
SQLite link: http://localhost:8035
Jupyter Lab link: http://localhost:8036/lab
Link: http://localhost:5001
INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/home/david/fh-dev-utils-test']
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:5001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [1988346] using WatchFiles
INFO:     Started server process [1988418]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

All links are placed next to each other for convenience making it easy
to select which server (FastHTML, Jupyter, or sqlite-web) you want to
open in the browser.

## Example FastHTML Apps

Here are a couple of examples of full minimal FastHTML apps that
implement the `fh-dev-utils` package to make development easier.
Remember to include a config file if using TailwindCSS so that live
reload and auto-intellisense works properly.

In both examples a `DEV_MODE` variable is used to easily switch between
development and production. When `DEV_MODE` is enabled it uses CSS
browser cache busting, and uses the `serve_dev()` function. Otherwise,
in production, the CSS is cached and the FastHTML `serve()` function is
used.

This first one is very simple and doesn’t include a database:

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from fh_dev_utils.serve import *

DEV_MODE=True

app,rt = fast_app(
    pico=False,
    live=True,
    hdrs=(
        Link(rel="stylesheet", href=f"/public/app.css{cache_buster() if DEV_MODE else ""}", type="text/css"),
    )
)

@rt('/')
def get():
    return Div(
        P('Hello World!', cls="text-[#bada55] bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-purple-600 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg"),
        P('Blue Background', cls="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 round"),
        P('Gradient Text', cls="bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-yellow-500 text-transparent bg-clip-text p-6"),
        cls="m-[41px] space-y-4"
    )

if DEV_MODE: serve_dev(tw=True, jupyter=True)
else: serve()
```

And here’s one that includes an SQLite database.

``` python
from fasthtml.common import *
from fh_dev_utils.serve import *

DEV_MODE=True

app,rt,todos,ToDo = fast_app('data/todos.db', id=int, title=str, pk='id', pico=True, live=True)

if not todos(): # Seed database if empty
    todos.insert_all([
        {"title": "Buy groceries"},
        {"title": "Finish blog post"},
        {"title": "Reply to emails"},
        {"title": "Plan weekend trip"},
        {"title": "Read AI research paper"}
    ]
)

def TodoRow(todo): return Li(todo.title, href=f'/todos/{todo.id}', id=f'todo-{todo.id}')

def home():
    add = Form(
            Group(
                Input(name="title", placeholder="New Todo"),
                Button("Add")
            ), action="/", method='post'
        )
    card = Card(
                Ul(*map(TodoRow, todos()), id='todo-list', style="padding:20px;"),
                header=add,
                footer=Div(id='current-todo')
            )
    return Titled('Todo list', card)

@rt("/")
def get(): return home()

@rt("/")
def post(todo:ToDo):
    todos.insert(todo)
    return home()

if DEV_MODE: serve_dev(db=True, db_path='data/todos.db')
else: serve()
```

This is a very minimal database app just as an illustrative example of
using `serve_dev()` to spin up a database browser. You can only add and
view todo items. However, using `sqlite-web` you can browse the database
and add/edit/remove items very easily!
