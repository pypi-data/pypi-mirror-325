## Overview üåê

**Lazyimports** is a Python module that enables lazy imports using native Python syntax, reducing startup time and improving performance by delaying module loading until needed.

## Installation üî®

Install `lazyimports` via pip:

```sh
pip install auto-lazy-imports
```

## Usage üëç

### 1. Using a `with` Statement

Wrap imports in a `with` statement to enable lazy loading:

```python
import lazyimports

with lazyimports.lazy_imports():
    from package import submodule

submodule.hello()
```

Note: By default, all modules under the with statement will be lazily loaded. However, you can also explicitly specify which packages to load lazily by providing them as arguments.
This is especially useful, if you want to use lazy objects

```python
import lazyimports

with lazyimports.lazy_imports("package:function", "package.subpackage"):
    import package.subpackage
    from package import function

package.subpackage.hello()
function()
```

### 2. Configuring via `pyproject.toml`

Define lazy-loaded modules and objects in pyproject.toml for package-based usage.

#### Standard configuration:

```toml
[project.entry-points.lazyimports]
"lazy_modules" = "package,package.submodule"
"lazy_functions" = "package:hello"
"lazy_objects" = "package:array,package:integer"
```

#### Poetry-based configuration:

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins.lazyimports]
"lazy_modules" = "package,package.submodule"
"lazy_functions" = "package:hello"
"lazy_objects" = "package:array,package:integer"
```

üí° The keys (lazy_modules, lazy_functions, etc.) can be listed in any order, using comma-separated values.

The previous example is also equivalent to:

```toml
[project.entry-points.lazyimports]
"custom_key" = "package,package.submodule,package:hello,package:array,package:integer"
```


After defining the configuration, import modules as usual‚Äîno code modifications needed:

```python
from package import submodule
from package import hello
```

### 3. Using an Environment Variable (for Development)

Dynamically enable lazy imports by setting an environment variable:

```sh
export PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS="package,package.submodule,package:array,package:integer,package:hello"
python script.py
```
