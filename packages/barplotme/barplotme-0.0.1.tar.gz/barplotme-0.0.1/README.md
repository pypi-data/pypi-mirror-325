# BarPlotMe
Plots numbers to a barplot. 

## Installation
`pip install barplot`
If there are missing dependencies, install them using pip. Maybe you learn something along the way. After all, we're are here to learn, aren't we?

## Usage
`barplotme 1 2 3 4` plots a stair-shaped barplot and saves it to `barplot.png`. I think it looks nice, doesn't it? Feel free to try your own numbers. There is no limit to creativity!
