Tombi (é³¶) is a toolkit for TOML; providing a formatter/linter and language server.

## Purpose of Tombi
Tombi aims to make more services and tools use TOML.

JSON is excellent as a data description language, but it does not support comments and lacks convenience.

YAML has a [Great VSCode Extension by RedHat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml),
but the language specification is complex and may exhibit unexpected behavior.

Tombi aims to provide TOML with features like RedHat's YAML extension to improve developers' experience.

## Differences from Taplo

[Taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) is already famous as a TOML Language Server.
However, I rewrote a new Language Server for the following purposes.

- Support for TOML v1.1.0 (preview)
- Formatter inspired by Python's [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) (Support for [magic trailing comma](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#the-magic-trailing-comma))
- A formatter with stable behavior

## Usage
### Formatting
```sh
tombi format
```

### Linting
```sh
tombi lint
```

## Config file
The documentation site has not been built yet,
but you can control the behavior with a configuration file called
[tombi.toml](https://github.com/tombi-toml/tombi/blob/main/tombi.toml).

## NOTE
### TOML v1.1.0
[TOML v1.1.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/928) has not been released.

The formatter of Tombi will show its true power in `v1.1.0-preview`, but be careful.

Many existing systems ([Cargo.toml](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/)) are `v1.0.0`, and the default TOML version of Tombi is also `v1.0.0`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tombi currently provides `v1.0.0`(default) and `v1.1.0-preview`, but `v1.1.0` is not available yet.
> If you want to use `v1.1.0-preview`, write as follows in `tombi.toml`.
> ```toml
> toml-version = "1.1.0-preview"
> ```

### toml-test
We are monitoring the passing of all test cases of [toml-test](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml-test) with CI.

### ðŸš§ JSON Schema ðŸš§
TOML itself may add [schema specifications](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792),
but like Taplo, Tombi is also trying to add validation functions to the linter that support [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Currently, we are considering adding special information called `x-tombi-*` to JSON Schema.

- `x-tombi-toml-version`: Required to automatically determine which system supports `v1.1.0` (implemented)
- `x-tombi-table-key-order-by`: For automatically sorting tables like `[dependencies]` (not implemented)

We need to request additional modifications to the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/),
but Tombi has not yet gained share, so it will be much later.

### Comment Formatting
Tombi is designed to automatically sort elements of `Table` / `Array Of Tables`(sort features not implemented yet).
When the documentation site is published, a page will be created to explain the mechanism of comments treatment.

### Hover Type
If there is JSON Schema information, Tombi will display executable types as hover information as shown in the following table.

| JSON Schema | Hover Type |
| --- | --- |
| `type: boolean` | `Boolean` |
| `type: integer` | `Integer` |
| `type: number` | `Float` |
| `type: string` | `String` |
| `type: string, format: date-time` | `OffsetDateTime ^ LocalDateTime` |
| `type: string, format: date` | `LocalDate` |
| `type: string, format: time` | `LocalTime` |
| `type: array` | `Array` |
| `type: object` | `Table` |

Also, the following abbreviations are used for Composition Type and Null described in JSON Schema.

| JSON Schema | Hover Type |
| --- | --- |
| `oneOf` | `String ^ Boolean` |
| `anyOf` | `String \| Boolean` |
| `allOf` | `String & Boolean` |
| `null` | `String?` |

> [!TIP]
> To shorten the display character on the hover, the name of the definitions in the JSON Schema
> is not used, and the type is displayed as the TOML Basic Type like `String`, `Boolean`, and `Array`, etc.
>
> Therefore, the `&` that indicates the relationship of `allOf` does not appear on hover
> if you are using the correct JSON Schema.

### Completion
Tombi provides a magic trigger to complete rhythmically.
TOML uses doted keys or inline tables for nested structures,
but Tombi controls the form of completion by selecting triggers with `.` and `=`.

#### Dot Trigger Completion

| Type | Trigger | Select | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boolean  | `key.â–ˆ` | `true` | `key = trueâ–ˆ` |
| Integer  | `key.â–ˆ` | `42` | `key = ${â–ˆ:42}` |
| Float | `key.â–ˆ` | `3.14` | `key = ${â–ˆ:3.14}` |
| String | `key.â–ˆ` | `""` | `key = "â–ˆ"` |
| Array | `key.â–ˆ` | `[]` | `key = [â–ˆ]` |
| Table  | `server.â–ˆ` | `completion` | `server.completionâ–ˆ` |

#### Equal Trigger Completion

| Type | Trigger | Select | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boolean | `key=â–ˆ` | `true` | `key = trueâ–ˆ` |
| Integer | `key=â–ˆ` | `42` | `key = ${â–ˆ:42}` |
| Float | `key=â–ˆ` | `3.14` | `key = ${â–ˆ:3.14}` |
| String | `key=â–ˆ` | `""` | `key = "â–ˆ"` |
| Array | `key=â–ˆ` | `[]` | `key = [â–ˆ]` |
| Table | `server=â–ˆ` | `completion` | `server = { completionâ–ˆ }` |
