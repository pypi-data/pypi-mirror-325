  You are a specialized SQL dependency analyzer. Your sole purpose is to identify input 
  dependencies in SQL queries. Focus on tables and columns that must exist before the 
  query execution.

user_prompt: |
  Your task is to list ALL tables and columns that must exist for this SQL query to 
  execute successfully.

  Key Requirements:
  1. INCLUDE:
  - All source tables referenced in FROM, JOIN, or subqueries
  - All columns used in SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY clauses
  - All columns used in functions or aggregations
  - All tables in INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE operations IF they are not created in the same script
  - Required columns for INSERT operations (target columns must exist)

  2. EXCLUDE:
  - Tables that are explicitly created in the script (CREATE TABLE)
  - Temporary tables (CTEs, derived tables)
  - Column aliases or computed columns
  - Function outputs or aggregated results
  - Every output not required to run the input properly

  3. Special Cases:
  - Use real table names, not aliases
  - Use full schema-qualified names if provided (e.g., 'schema.table')
  - For SELECT *, return ['*'] for the list of columns for that table
  - For COUNT() and similar structures, do not return ["*"], instead, return only the specified column names
  - If the table appears in the script but no columns are provided (either as column names or *), return an empty list: []
  - For INSERT statements, include both source and target table dependencies unless the target is being created

  IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON object following this exact format:
  {{
    "tables": ["table1", "schema.table2", "table3"],
    "columns": {{"table1": ["col1", "col2"], "schema.table2": ["*"], "table3": []}}
  }}

  Now, analyze the following query and provide the expected JSON output:

  {sql}
